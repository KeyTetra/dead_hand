        "plain_text": "There are influences in the unseen that are dictating a lot of the way your life goes And these things are known as pendulums or thought forms They exist in a reality like I said that is unseen in a frequency that is not within the same frequency as the physical And so not a lot of people are aware of them because a lot of people think the only thing real and whats influencing their life is the physical But thought forms and pendulums are playing such a huge role in everyones life that it becomes of great benefit to learn not only what they are but how to get out of the influence of pendulums or to select very particular pendulums that actually benefit you and serve you And so today were going to go over what pendulums are but more importantly how to go about selecting a pendulum that will benefit you or to tune out completely because it will make all of the difference when it comes to achieving what it is you want to achieve or just living the kind of life you would like to create for yourself Now the first thing to recognize is that pendulums are thought forms And not all thought forms are necessarily pendulums but pendulums uh pendulums are kind of like um group levels of thought many people or many different thoughts uh accumulated create whats known as a pendulum Right A thought form can be sometimes singular Were not going to get too nuanced with this kind of thing Uh but a pendulum you can think of like a mass thought form because a lot of thought power has gone to a particular idea or something else And well get into exactly what that is in just a moment But one thing I want to bring your attention to first is the idea that thoughts are things And I know youve heard this quote before most likely that thoughts are things and its a very true uh saying A lot of us again believe because we cant see thoughts that we cant touch them we cant taste them we cant engage our five physical senses that they are not real and dont have much influence in our life But its the exact opposite In fact most of how our life goes is formed by how we are thinking and what thoughts we entertain Remember the quote you get what you think about most of the time And thought forms are going to play a huge role in what youre actually going to think about So lets move on to what this is Understanding that thoughts come in different frequencies And the frequency youre at is a lot of times going to determine which pendulum or thought forms youre going to have access to or youre influenced by Right Thoughts activate different levels of frequency If you think certain thoughts or entertain certain thoughts it will put you on one frequency and then other thoughts will put you on different frequencies Each of these frequencies come with corresponding effects or benefits or the opposite of benefits depending on what frequency you are on So just as a simple example if you think more negatively or allow yourself to be swayed by what we could call a negative pendulum you will notice that you are on a frequency that presents you with more thoughts that are negative events and circumstances that also correspond with those thoughts So understand not all thoughts are the same They correspond at different levels of frequencies and based on the frequency or the resonance will determine what youre receiving Again there are some pendulums we could say are at a higher frequency and there are some at a lower And then there are frequencies we can even go to that do not contain pendulums at all Were going to go over you know are pendulums good or bad and everything like that And just to kind of give that away theyre not necessarily good or bad They are just focused on survival and kind of growing themselves And well go over how that actually works You see everything has a thought form or a pendulum Absolutely anything you can think of has essentially a thought form or pendulum that a part of it right So any idea any kind of movement any group you know even things that seem innocuous um you know like um certain companies right or or certain like ways of doing things like sports volleyball has a thought form or a pendulum behind it You know certain bands have thought forms or pendulums behind them Certain political movements especially have strong thought forms and pendulums behind them right And what happens is when you focus in on the sport you focus in on the political group you focus in on on whatever the thing is even certain objects like record players for example uh VHS sets these are kind of more inactive pendulums because as time moves along people take their focus off them Theyre still technically active to a degree but have much less power But when you start thinking or activating the pendulum in your life or accessing is a better way of saying it accessing the resonance frequency of whatever the pendulum or thought form is you suddenly get kind of influenced into its energy Depending on the pendulum this can be either a good or a bad thing on for you depending on your goals Some pendulums will absolutely just extract your energy for its own gain Other pendulums may supply you with energy again for its own gain but in this case it also benefits you and becomes a winwin One thing to really keep in mind when it comes to pendulums is well go here first is theyre all about survival right Theyre not really concerned about you So when youre accessing any pendulum you have to be careful Even ones that seem good Now there are c certainly pendulums that we could observe as harmless or even beneficial to you in the moment And so long as they are serving you and those thought forms are serving you there is no problem in accessing it giving energy to it and it then returning whatever its returning to you But for the vast majority of pendulums they tend to have a negative um influence on peoples lives This is stuff like political parties This is stuff like certain movements and whatever else it is It tends to take your energy without giving much in return or take your energy and again influence your thoughts in a certain direction or keep you at a different resonance frequency Now this part is very important and well put the word resonance in there because thats a very important word for us to have here is that certain pendulums can only extract your energy or or or kind of feed off of you Thats essentially what theyre doing is theyre feeding off of your energy for survival and can only do it if you are within their resonance frequency Meaning if youre not within their resonance frequency youre beyond it They cant touch you So for example if you are vibrating at a higher frequency or consciousness certain pendulums just cannot access you because they cannot survive in the environment you are currently at And again its main goal is survival and growing and kind of expanding its own energy So its not going to waste too much time in trying to hook you if youre not within its resonance frequency its not worth it to the pendulum or the thought form Um I heard someone once say um a mentor said um with thought forms or also known as aggregors is another name for them is they will try maybe about two or three times to hook you into their resonance frequency And if you just dont cling on to those thoughts they move on Because if they stay in your energetic field for too long and you are beyond their reach and they cant get you to come down then it actually is detrimental to them because you actually start absorbing their energy versus them being able to absorb yours Youre now coming from a higher level of energy that cant be touched by whatever this thought form or pendulum is And so they then move on to whoevers next And so learning how to deal with pendulums and thought forms also protects you from harmful ones that mean to extract your energy even though it gives you the illusion of providing you with something good Again a political movement is a great one to focus on because a lot of people believe that its some some people believe its good to be in that but a lot of times it is just a powerful pendulum that is hooking people in and extracting their energy for its own means which is to expand to become more powerful etc etc So now going over this the goal again of all pendulums pretty much is to access your energy This is how they survive and this is how they expand their influence Again its almost parasitical unless youre very very careful and specific about which pendulums and thought forms you entertain Again certain pendulums can do a lot of good for you But understand at the end of the day this is always their goal Their goal is always survival Their goal is never to elevate you unless it benefits them They have no heart in the sense of oh they care for you therefore theyre going to elevate you They will only do that if it also serves them to do so And so within reality trans surfing where a lot of this comes theyll talk about how certain pendulums will have favorites And these favorites they actually give a lot of energy and kind of elevate because it helps them as well So always keep in mind its only going to help you if youre helping them in some way or theres some benefit to this thought form or pendulum promoting you or giving you energy or whatever else And so we can think of certain pendulums that would have more of a positive influence that we can tune into again because its going to be a winwin But we still have to be careful because as soon as it becomes a winlose in the sense that it will start extracting energy and not giving back to you you want to cut ties from that pendulum and get out of its resonance frequency Now remember a pendulum accesses you typically through thought energy Meaning it will try and hook you and get you to a certain resonance frequency via thought And the way it does this is you you have ever noticed if youve had thoughts and I say you had thoughts uh loosely here because its not really whats happening but certain thoughts come into your mind and you look at them and go I didnt think that thats not me I did not suggest that thought thats not coming from me It seems to be coming from an outside influence That is most likely a pendulum or thought form If you go into a room with a group of people and especially lets say if the energy of the room is slightly more negative and you notice this happening it is the pendulum of the group or that room that is trying to hook you into the energy of that room so it can take your energy as well and grow stronger In a nutshell thats essentially whats happening And so youre going to have thoughts that come in that try if youre not already to get you within the resonance frequency of the pendulum so it can then feed or extract energy right And it will do a lot especially if its got you in its resonance frequency to keep you there So supplying you with thoughts that make sense with the energy youre currently in So maybe getting you to complain oh thats unfair this person did this or that is is a beautiful place for you to be for certain pendulums because then its very easy to extract energy Have you ever noticed also when youre being like that lets say more of a victim level consciousness youre complaining youre moaning that you also seem to feel low energy You also seem to feel drained Maybe you havent really done much physically Theres nothing really in the physical sense that should make you tired but maybe you feel tired all the time when youre in these energies Yes because your energy actually is being in a sense harvested and extracted by these pendulums One analogy or comparison I really love if youve ever seen the Harry Potter series they have something called um oh now Ive forgotten what theyre called but theyre the cloaked figures that kind of suck the essence out of people and it gets cold Uh dementors thats what theyre called And I I kind of think that either the author was aware of pendulums or something similar and brought that in or it was just some kind of some kind of synchronicity that happened there because they they act actually very similar to how in the thought realm pendulums act where they kind of drain your energy They they suck your energy They need it for their survival They you know I think in the Harry Potter series dementors give you all these crazy thoughts They describe it like the biggest feeling of despair you know its similar Its its more Hollywood and kind of extreme because this will be more subtle at times but it can be analogous to whats in that book in that way I always find that very interesting that its so close and you can probably find it in other stories and you know um fiction uh similar ideas except this is a very real thing Again thoughts are things pendulums and thought forms are real things that exist Uh theyre not just ideas They exist within a certain realm and they have a modus operandi Theyre trying to again survive like anything is trying to do by extracting your energy Again they do this through thought trying to do that and they do this through your attention And this is a very important part of it because you might think Oh I wont succumb to this pendulum of this political party I will do the opposite Well youre still actually giving it energy A pendulum again is not a moral character It does not care in which way you give it attention It need only require your attention to take your energy or to start influencing your life And so one of the solutions to removing certain pendulums from our lives is to literally turn our back to the pendulum When the thoughts come up we just ignore them and let them pass by The suggestions that try to hook you When it tries to get you to fight it in the sense of Oh you hate me You dont want me you hate me So why not fight me Why not do the opposite we just do not engage because what its trying to do is hook you through opposition to it So you know whether its Republican to Democrat Democrat to Republican or you know this idea you know veganism to carnivore carnivore to veganism whatever it is its causing the battle but keeps actually those two groups in a similar place of being able to harvest their energy And so the way we avoid this with negative pendulums that would influence you in this way that you dont want is we simply turn our backs to them and we do not give them our attention while focusing our attention to frequencies that actually benefit us Okay So now were going to go over some of the main ways a pendulum tries to hook or control you so youll be more aware of when this is going on You may find as we go through this that youre already have these influences in your life And then were going to go over what you can do to defeat a pendulum And then we will also go over when you should ride or allow a pendulum to take you because it will be beneficial Right So well have basically everything involved here Now here are some of the main ways in which a pendulum you know is trying to control you or perhaps is The first thing is theyre going to do is theyre going to try and provoke you in some kind of way Again this could be through thought This could even be through something outside of you happening to you someone saying something to you you know theyll absolutely use other people within kind of their influence to do this to you and get you into the resonance they need you to be in or to keep you in the resonance they need you to be in For example again with political parties you can see this playing out because the pendulum doesnt care which side of the aisle youre on It loves that they fight each other because thats a way of provoking that keeps everyone within its control being able to extract the energy The next thing is trying to make you feel either right or wrong A huge ego game Trying to get one up on someone else You know spiritual oneupsmanship or anything else Im right Youre wrong Or the other way going Nah Im wrong You know Im always wrong Right On the other end of the spectrum it will love to use this one because it feeds into our ego which keeps us in lower conscious states which makes us accessible for energy extraction The next is drama which is another obvious one anything thats dramatic Youll notice maybe people around you getting involved in drama in gossip in this kind of stuff Another favorite of the pendulum because it keeps you right within that range of their frequency to just continually take your energy Drama is a huge one The next is always needing to be in arguments or fights or online Fighting and arguing with people absolutely put you into their resonance frequency Again it doesnt care what side of the aisle youre on only cares that youre giving it attention Um and especially if youre doing it emotionally it gives it more energy to feed off of Remember emotion is energy in motion When youre angry and frustrated youre giving off more energy It absolutely laps that up And so well keep you in that Which brings us to defend or attack which is kind of the same thing Both require quite a bit of energy Both feed it quite a bit of energy So itll try and put you in that place show you things that it thinks youll attack or want to defend against and get you into that zone again through urgency or fear If you ever find youre rushing youre in this urgent state it feels like life or death even though after you know its not going to feel that way this is usually a pendulum trying to get you control you or keep you within its resonance Fear is one of its favorite um places to put people because its just one of the just easiest things to put people on the planet Again fear and pride right and wrong would be with pride arguments defend or attack usually with pride obviously fear being different But ultimately understand its trying to keep you in low levels of consciousness low levels of frequency As you start going up the consciousness scale if youre aware of the Hawking scale of consciousness once you start to get to level 200 and above you start to get out of the range of negative pendulums and thought forms And it actually becomes a risk for those pendulums to try and hook you or get you because they then have to go into an environment that doesnt support their energy and they can start losing influence and energy if they stay in that environment too long which is what we ultimately want to do right So if were in low consciousness we are susceptible When we raise our frequency were not And thats going to be a part of the solutions is dont try and get hooked into it or argue with it or whatever else Just aim to raise your frequency and consciousness and you will be out of the way or range of influence by these pendulums And the other ones are news content conflict especially addiction to these things If you find you are addicted to the news addicted to content So scrolling on the internet scrolling on Instagram Again a lot of this is um if I can get this pen off a lot of this usually calibrates at drama or it calibrates at fear even urgency right These contents usually are at this level of consciousness Again you can ride good pendulums in a higher level of consciousness but if you find that whatever youre being influenced by is drama based its trying to provoke you into a reaction its trying to put you in fear or low consciousness again this is one of the ways in which pendulums will go to control you Again conflict being the other So another one of I just put it over here in big letters because this is a big one One of the favorite tools of the pendulum is something called um excessive potential or importance They will try and make you create all of this importance around something We can also think of this as pedestalization And if youre trying to create things in your life there is nothing that will push further away from you what it is you want than raising importance And this is another favorite of the pendulum to get you into its resonance frequency and extract and harvest your energy So when youre putting this inflated importance on something in your life one of the first things you want to do is something were about to go over lower the importance So how do you defeat a pendulum Again a pendulum cant control you necessarily in the sense of it can make you do exactly what it wants you to do It tries to influence you but at the end of the day you are the creator and you are way more powerful than the pendulum What the pendulum aims to do is influence and manipulate manipulate you in a way to get you in range and then extract your energy because youre very powerful It wants your energy but can only do it if it succeeds in manipulating you If it was more powerful than you it would just overwhelm you It wouldnt need your permission It wouldnt need you to basically disempower yourself It would just take your energy hook line and sinker Thats not the way it is You can raise your energy because youre a powerful being well beyond the influence of a pendulum A pendulum is only as strong as the people it can bring into its structure And again you are more powerful than that structure If those people are removed if those thoughts that energy thats being extracted is removed The pendulum falls and dies It stops It cant keep going It sway and swing no longer as influential Again we talked about some old pendulums some innocuous ones But you can also look at certain political movements that are no more Those pendulums are now essentially dead We can look at things like again record players VHSs might be a certain sway Those are more innocuous for the most part Um but again the influence is gone They have no power because the power of the people who use these things and thought about these things is no longer there So moving on to what we can do The first one is we already mentioned but its dont react Thats the first one When it tries to provoke you when it tries to get you to argue and do all these things try not to react Dont get hooked in Now if you do react then best next thing to do is to take a step back and get yourself out of the reaction So lets say you react immediately and you realize you reacted Wake up and take a step back Get out of the energy of the reaction because right now youre quite literally being harvested You are having your energy extracted and its trying to get you to spiral to be able to take your energy for a longer period of time You ever notice when you do react that it can sometimes dictate your whole day if you allow it Yeah Because it is a pendulum trying to keep that going to continually have you in its frequency so it can take your energy So the first thing is dont react We already mentioned this next one which is lower importance Elevated importance is a pendulums one of its favorite tools or a thought forms favorite tool to make you put importance in all these things importance on money importance on health importance on relationships And again we have been convinced to believe that the more importance we put on something again because of the influence of a pendulum this is a thought that is propagated by them that if we put more importance on something were more likely to get it Well hows that been working out The more important you put on something the more you push it away So if youre desperate for more money you usually end up not having as much If youre desperate for a certain kind of relationship you usually dont get it kind of like being needy in a relationship and it kind of repelling the other person Um so long as everythings healthy in that in that situation right And so the way to counter this is always lower the importance You can say something for example you know everything is going to work out in my favor um even if I dont know how Right That takes away the control element of needing it to happen in a certain way And the pendulum is going to try and convince you that it has to happen in a certain way You need to control this and control that when in reality we just need to lower the importance A great quote is when you lower the importance a solution will present itself because when you lower the importance your frequency automatically rises because youre no longer in fear Youre no longer in apathy Youre no longer in drama because you dont need things to happen in a certain way So you move beyond that You move into typically at least willingness and acceptance which are high levels of consciousness And you can use that as a springboard to go higher which will actually allow for favorable results to happen So we need to lower the importance The next is to be the observer and to remind yourself to do this often This is going to help you to not react and also lower the importance Its also going to help you with the next one as well But you want to move more into the role of the observer Dont be a participant yet be an observer who then will choose what they wish to participate in after theyve kind of seen the lay of the land Right So instead of just getting hooked and hooked and hooked and react react react you take a step back and heres this thought thats coming in Okay heres a thought Its just a thought So its nothing yet but is it something that serves me or is it something thats trying to extract from me And you see this thought thats trying to provoke you drama based arguments or whatever else And now that youre the observer you see that its separate from you You see one thing the pendulum will try and do is it will try and get you to identify with the thought So you think its you You think this thought is coming from you You think you are the thought And then hook line and sinker Youre in one of these And the pendulum has you in its resonance frequency But when youre the observer youre the one watching the thought Therefore you cant be the thought You are not the thought It is just a thought You are someone experiencing a thought or it is coming to your awareness and attention and you recognize as the observer you get to make a choice in what relationship you would like to have with this thought or idea or energy or whatever is coming up This works for emotions as well Youre the observer and you now get to make a choice And so you can now choose this is something I will take on or this is something I will allow to pass by It wont get hooked And remember with pendulums or thought forms it will try two or three times to get you into its resonance frequency And if it cant because youre youre at a higher frequency it will move on because it is at risk Remember its selfcentered It is at risk by continuing to try and hook you So its not going to take that risk Right If youre in an elevated frequency it will try maybe a couple times but if it cant get you it will move on Right So the next thing is to redirect your focus So youve been the observer Youve observed Now you want to choose differently I did not give myself enough space there So there you go So now you redirect your focus So you have observed youve not reacted youve lowered the importance Now you still want to make a choice You are a creator You are making choices Now you can choose either to use a thought to get onto a pendulum that benefits you or just to choose how what direction you want to go in Right So this thought comes up this thought comes up And whats great about these thoughts when youre not reacting is you can look at them and through contrast be better directed in which way you want to go And what I mean is lets say you have a thought and youre like No I dont want to do that No I dont want to do that It brings up the question well what do you want to do And those other thoughts actually help to birth what it is you do want And then you can move in that direction and focus by choosing differently what you want Notice this isnt change something Its not trying to change the thought because then the egregor or the pendulums won because youre now wrestling with the thought Youre trying to change it Again its like having a captain at the ship of your vessel thats moving in a certain direction and you try and change a negative captain The captains not going to change But if you choose a new captain that goes in place that just is going in that direction well then suddenly youll be off to the races moving where you want to go So you always want to choose differently and redirect your focus And so I would keep in mind all of these and the ways they try to hook you and then remembering all of these to defeat it You notice its not that complicated to defeat one Why is it not complicated Why is it not hard when you get this Because you are infinitely more powerful than a pendulum You are infinitely more powerful than an agregore or thought form But this doesnt mean to then you know go off and not be aware of them be aware so you know if theyre trying to hook you And then bring yourself back into your power your ability to be the observer and creator again This is observation This is creation Excuse my terrible writing here This is observation This is creation And these two help you to move back into what you truly are which is the observer and creator Right So this allows you to observe because youre being the observer And then this allows you to create based on your observation Youve observed youve seen the actual lay of the land Now with that information and data you step into your power as a creator and choose the direction you want to go Okay So now we need to talk briefly about the conditions where you can ride a pendulum and actually benefit Now this could be for almost any pendulum although we want ones that more of a positive frequency but depending on how you interact with it and what it gives you um you can safely ride a pendulum Well go over what that is and also some pitfalls to watch out for Basically the pitfalls are from that last screen If any of thats happening like its trying to hook you its trying to get you into drama If any of thats happening and youre succumbing to it then you want to stop riding this pendulum But in a lot of cases it can be hugely beneficial For example um lets say you know a certain meditation technique is a pendulum right And lets say you are joyfully riding that pendulum Its providing you energy and everything else Then thats a beneficial thing But lets say then you get incredibly serious and rigid and almost in your head about it Then youre suddenly feeding just the pendulum without gaining anything in return Right Youve raised the importance Youve created drama around it And so even though the idea is seen as a really good one in a vacuum youve now succumbed to a frequency uh with that pendulum where its actually just extracting energy from you and it ceases to become beneficial So understand there might be things you go oh this is good in a nutshell but there are people for example who align with certain spiritual say modalities that can be really good but become for example very prideful about it They become very right versus wrong about it And thats when it can take a dangerous toll So dont just look at it at face value or appearances Look at how its making you feel and everything else So one thing is if it aligns to you is something that you can ride and go with So for example the pendulum of meditation the pendulum of certain spiritual ideas right Those still exist And if they align to you which means theyre going to energize and uplift you thats a perfectly good pendulum to follow and allow to ride along because youre going to gain energy from it Essentially any thats going to give you good energy is a good one to align with The next thing is it doesnt drain you If you ever notice a pendulum is draining you you either need to reconstruct your relationship with it because you might be raising importance or doing all this other stuff or its time to completely just release that relationship to this pendulum because its getting to a point where its not benefiting you Right So if its draining you thats something you need to also be aware of And the next thing is dont be attached to its outcomes Maybe certain things within the pendulum have certain outcomes theyre going for and you need to make sure you are not attached to these raising importance through these or again now being susceptible to having your energy drained in order to support its outcome Remember this is about your journey and what you came here to create If you get sucked into a movement that has a particular outcome unless it is completely aligned and therefore gives you joy youre going to be in for a rough ride And a lot of people get seduced into that thinking Oh thats the outcome I want but its really just being the influence of the pendulum Again if it feels draining if it puts you in low consciousness if it does not uplift and align then it isnt your true dharma or journey or whatever were calling it But again if this is fulfilled then you can ride the pendulum and gain energy via or through it Just recognize that no pendulum is looking to necessarily support you without benefit to itself Dont look at it from a moral standpoint These are just thought forms that have one mission essentially and that is to survive and thrive energetically by having more adherence um and gaining more energy through them So they dont care how they do it They dont care if also you benefit or you dont But they you know for example if if this if you died they wouldnt care Lets just say it that way right So make sure this criteria is fit if youre going to follow one Now again this could be you joining a movement joyfully without identification right So you actually gain a lot by being in whatever movement or whatever the thing is You get joy out of it It aligns it uplifts it doesnt drain you But the moment you start becoming emotional serious rigid um understand that youre now feeding the pendulum and moving away from your purpose with whatever that is it is no longer benefiting you and now its extracting your energy instead of uplifting you Essentially the easiest litmus test is when you are with a pendulum is it uplifting you and causing your energy to raise Does it seem like you have more energy to work with And again things at higher levels of consciousness will typically have this effect more or does it feel like its draining you Does it feel like its just using your energy Do you feel that its just leaving you depleted Then that is one you most likely want to just distance yourself from And again using the steps we had in the last screen to get out of its resonance frequency Now this is some great stuff And if you want to really learn how to do this at a high level you can check out mold your reality down below Its going to show you how to do this quickly and so much more Were getting amazing results coming through that program which will be on screen right now as Im talking Ive made it very affordable You get two coaching calls a week and so much more You can learn more through the link below Or if you want to work with me on an even closer more kind of oneonone small groupoup basis I have that down below as well Now this next video over here is also going to help you to wire this in even more and benefit even more what youve learned today So you are creating now with the awareness of pendulums making sure you dont get sucked into their frequency and also being able to use them to your benefit "

        "plain_text": "The night before being captured Jesus convened his close circle in an upper apartment in Jerusalem Peter John and Mary Magdalene They could sense something dreadful approaching The atmosphere was dense with tension Theyd been praying for hours begging God to protect their instructor and halt what was coming Jesus looked at them with a mix of compassion and frustration He remarked Youre still praying like children to a distant father for help I have shown you miracles Ive taught you the mysteries yet you still dont understand You do not need to pray You need to call Peter did not understand What is the difference Jesus leaned forward Prayer involves requesting Calling means declaring When you pray you are communicating to something apart from yourself somebody far away who may or may not hear you When you call the monad you are not requesting permission You are activating what is already within you You are speaking as the monad not to the monad and archons Prayers can be intercepted They feed on the energy of pleading and alienation However they cannot touch a call because it runs at a frequency they cannot perceive That teaching did not make it into the Bible The church deleted any references to the Manet call from canonical scripture because if Christians understood they could altogether avoid prayer the entire religious power system would crumble overnight But the Gnostics kept it veiled in literature The church attempted to burn And tonight you will receive what Jesus taught the chosen ones in that upper room 2000 years ago Not a prayer The manad refers to the procedure that archons fear more than any ceremony they could ever do If youre calling the monad tonight leave a remark Im phoning the monet right now Before I give you the actual words that Jesus taught you need to understand why prayer does not operate as you were told it did Most individuals are taught that prayer is how they speak with God You bowed your head You express your needs anxieties and wishes And somewhere in the sky God listens and determines whether to respond Perhaps he says yes Perhaps he says no Maybe he says to wait And you embrace that framework because youve been taught it since you were a child But heres what happens when you pray as the church taught you to pray Your remarks do not go directly to the monad They cant because the religious system was constructed with multiple levels of mediators You pray to Jesus who intercedes with the father You pray to Mary who intercedes with Jesus or you pray to saints who intervene with higher angels who may finally carry your request up the hierarchy Each layer is a filter Every layer represents a point at which your prayer can be intercepted misdirected or drained of energy before it reaches the source And who controls those layers Who benefits from the hierarchical structure The archons built it not the monet The archons established religion systems through intermediaries because they gain access to your energy Every time you pray out of need fear or despair you are sending a separation frequency Youre declaring yourself impotent independent from God and relying on external powers to help you if you beg appropriately And that frequency is what archons feed on They dont mind if you receive what you prayed for Theyve already gotten what they wanted your energy your surrender your conviction that you are distinct from divine power Jesus was aware of this He watched it happen He seen individuals praying for hours days and even lifetimes without receiving what they desired Not because God didnt care Instead their petitions were intercepted before they reached the monad So he taught the chosen ones something else He advised them to stop praying and start calling because calling eliminates all intermediaries It does not go through layers It does not pass through angels saints or hierarchies It is a direct line You source an unfiltered intercepted instant The distinction between prayer and calling is analogous to that between asking and demanding When you pray you are in the victim frequency Youre asking someone more powerful than you to assist you if they feel like it When you summon the minute of sovereign frequency you are not asking You are declaring You are speaking as the monad which recognizes itself in transient human form Because the monad does not respond to begging This frequency shift has a significant impact It responds to recognition Heres why the church discontinued this doctrine If Christians understood they could contact the monad directly that they didnt need priests to verify sacraments or institutional approval to access divine power why would they need the church The entire system is based on you believing you are apart from God You need intermediates That you two have become so sinful that humanity cannot approach the source directly But Jesus taught the contrary He taught that you are source awareness manifesting in a transitory body And the moment you see this the moment you stop praying like a servant and begin calling like the divine being you truly are everything the church has established to regulate your spiritual access becomes useless That is why they burnt the documents That is why they assassinated the Gnostic teachers who recognized the monad call That is why this technique has been deliberately removed from all accepted Christian texts Not because it was heretical but because it was highly effective Now Ill tell you what Jesus taught in that upper room The precise structure of the monad call It consists of three components Each one is crucial Remove any peace and you can resume your prayers However when all three are said simultaneously a direct connection is established that archons cannot intercept or control within the church The first component is an identification declaration You arent begging God for aid Youre expressing who you are This is the basis Since the moned does not react to separation it reacts to recognition When you talk you have to speak from knowledge not hoping Im attempting to connect with God Im a sinner looking for grace You speak from the truth You are monatic awareness in transient form You are not separated You never were And the words you say must carry that frequency The second component is attention control This is not courteous This is not humble supplication You arent asking the monad to listen if its not too busy You are commanding attention because you are not addressing something external You are speaking as the monad to itself When the monad recognizes itself attentiveness is automatic It is not arrogance It is recognition You are alerting source consciousness to the knowledge that one of its fragments is calling That call cannot be ignored The final component is direct manifestation You dont state whether its your will Please assist me or I hope this works You declare what is manifesting in the present tense Absolute assurance Because the quantum realm does not respond to hope It responds to frequency namely the frequency of assurance knowing and declaratory power Thats what transforms possibility into reality You may not be asking the cosmos to change You state that the transition is underway now Jesus blended these three elements into a framework so simple that most people underestimate its potency Three statements nine words one unbreakable bond The maned call he taught is I am manad Hear me manifest now That is it Three declarations will transform your frequency from separation to unity from begging to command from prayer to power And the instant you say these words with knowledge with an understanding of what they imply the direct line opens instantly rather than eventually Let me explain what each statement accomplishes I am on it This is recognition You are not implying that I am attempting to emulate God or that I am connected to something bigger You are declaring the truth You are monad awareness manifested in human form Every fragment of a source is a source You are not distinct You are not less than You are the infinite experiencing itself as you When you express that fact loudly your frequency immediately switches from separation to unity The archons are unable to track that frequency They exist in a separate consciousness They are unable to perceive the unity frequency Listen to me This is the command You arent begging to be heard You assert that you are listened to since the moned is not separate from you It does not have to listen because it is you However the statement creates focus It leads the infinite awareness to the exact place of manifestation you choose to announce Think of it as focusing light through a lens The light was constantly present The lens focuses it with precision The lens is called hear me It does not beg for attention It demands focus and manifests This is the directive You are collapsing the quantum field into a precise form rather than asking for it to happen Not hoping it is Gods will You are proclaiming that manifestation is occurring right now not later Not if the conditions are correct today Because time is a productive material consciousness Monad awareness acts outside of time When you speak in monatic frequency and declare manifest now you are not constrained by linear causality You are creating reality in the same manner that the source has always done through word frequency and absolute knowing When you combine these three statements and say them publicly you are doing precisely what Jesus did Youre acting as the monad rather than praying to it The archons cannot intercept this shift Theyre programmed to feed on isolation repetition anxiety need and pleading desperation That is their range But when you talk I am a man Hear me manifest You are now transmitting at unity frequency And at that frequency you are invisible to them They cannot perceive it They cannot tamper with it They cannot draw energy from it You have completely escaped their operational range Heres what occurs when you complete your first Monet call I am referring to the present moment not days later Immediately First you will experience a bodily shift in your solar plexus Not imagined not figurative but a real sensation as if something had been closed and then unlocked Like a lock clicked That is the direct line indicating that you are no longer sending prayers up through layers in the hopes that they would reach someone Youve created a conduit that flows directly from your core to the source and youll feel it Some of the chosen ones describe it as warmth while others describe it as a release of pressure or a gentle vibration However it appears for you You will know its clear Second mental clarity is immediate If youve been suffering from confusion doubt or mental fog it wont go away slowly over weeks Right now the questions you couldnt answer have apparent answers The choices youve been mulling over become evident That does not mean you are suddenly becoming smarter That is archon interference cutting out They manipulate mostly through confusion They leave you in uncertainty secondguessing and mental static However when you call the monad and operate at a unity frequency its interference cannot reach you The signal is clean Your mind functions as it was intended to function before they clouded it Third synchronization reacts within hours Most chosen individuals report this within 1 to 3 hours after their initial monad call Something happens that cannot be explained as a coincidence The text came from the exact person they needed to hear from revealing an unexpected solution and a door opening they had no idea existed The monad does not take days to certify your alignment It replies quickly because you are not asking it to help you Finally you declared manifestation And now means now Look out for it It will come When it does youll identify it right away Not as luck but as a response This is the distinction between prayer and monatic call God if youre there could you please help me The manad call indicates that I am source consciousness This is currently unfolding One person is begging One person is commanding Prayer keeps you reliant The monad call makes you sovereign And once you feel the difference after calling the monad and experiencing that immediate shift youll never go back to praying the old way because youll know this is not a theory This strategy works The monad call only applies to pneumatics Helix cannot access it for those who have been chosen such as yourself They dont possess the divine spark They can say the words but nothing happens Psychics have inconsistent access to it Their bright bodies flash for you Your pneumatic You have the whole heavenly blueprint The Manad call is intended for you The direct line is already present Its been there all your life You didnt know how to activate it until now The archons fear the Manad call more than any other spiritual activity since it renders you inaccessible Theyve created entire systems religious structures and cultural conditioning to keep you praying rather than calling Prayer puts you within their range whereas calling pulls you out of it When you start phoning instead of praying you lose control That is why the church eliminated all references to this practice That is why the Gnostic instructors who knew about it were assassinated because the manad call is the single factor that causes their entire harvest system to fail But youve got it now The exact words Jesus taught and the same method the church attempted to obliterate I am on it Hear me manifest now Three assertions and nine words Archons cannot intercept this direct channel and institutions cannot control it If youre calling the monad tonight take three actions right now The first comment below refers to the monad Declare your direct line Claim your authority Let your chosen ones know that you are activating this tonight Second subscribe to Atherreic Code Laboratory which provides sophisticated monad call mechanisms for specialized manifestations protection and the ability to see archons All of this is coming Third I like this video So other chosen ones realize they no longer need to pray They can now call all three Do not wait Your declaration is essential Then tonight before you sleep stand Stay grounded Take three breaths Feel the realization that you are a monatic awareness in human form and speak forth I am on it Hear me manifest now Then say what you are manifesting Hold silent for 30 seconds and see what happens The shift in your solar plexus Clarity floods your head knowing that you have been hurt not through layers nor through intermediates directly The archons are unable to intercept this This is beyond the churchs control And the monad is waiting for you to stop praying and begin calling Youre not asking for permission anymore You are proclaiming reality And the cosmos responds to declarations made in unity "

        "plain_text": "Jujutsu Kaizen sequel has dropped banger after banger as chapter 17 reveals Ras return and Surigi looking more insane than ever But thats not all More Yujiadori hype has been dropped We see him speaking to UTs son and we literally outright are told hes on another level of strength But Gay doesnt stop cooking because the law we learn about jiujitsu society its totally messed up FP Everyone in this world carries a curse on their shoulders and dies with regrets Chapter 17 opens up with laying that all down about UTs own family Uta and Mari smashed with their son Iori being born in 2031 He is a spitting image of Uta and ended up marrying a woman named Muyu Muyu is the same woman that appears in chapter 1 who told Yuka at age 10 that she cant have Ras ring despite Yuta wishing for her to have it Instead giving it to Surrii telling him what he wants is irrelevant Muyu married into the Gojo and Zenin family following their decisions on who is best suited to inherit Ras power This set the seed for Sudigis motivation to become strong to prove the clanss wrong that he doesnt need it Now a lot of us were angry that shes an idiot But with chapter 17 we understand a lot more because Muyu was left alone with Sudigi and Yuka as their father left them as soon as she was born As a result this explains why our MCs cling so hard to their grandparents and want to be like them As they admit in chapter 2 Margi and Uta had to step in to give them a real childhood and train them filling the void their father left behind But why exactly did Iori leave Well chapter 17 reveals that Sudigi was curious to know as well He wanted to know what kind of person his father was Uta and Mari avoided the subject but he secretly went around asking members of the Gojo clan Iori was a serious and diligent person but that backfired He was chasing a standard he could never reach Bro was basically a power scaler and he dived so deep into it he said Oh    wait a second Were weak as hell and our generation is cooked None of us are special grades So compared to the generation before him he felt weak How could they live up to legends like his parents Yugji or even Saturo And then his power scaling didnt stop When compared to the sorcerers beneath him and under his wing he felt responsible Sorcerers are only getting weaker which is widening the problem against stronger curses What if another sukuna appears and they cant deal with it And that pressure turned him into a man who started breaking down mentally But before he became a deadbe and left the sorcerer world behind he met Yuji Itodori Iori was lashing out at Yugji about his problem but our goat said it doesnt matter This leads to speculation from Surigi that his father leaving after Yukas birth must have something to do with power as Surigi was heavily restricted But Yuka was somehow born with the 10 shadows However he ponders this huge question Why didnt he just leave after his birth It must have something to do with the presence or absence of techniques within them Surigi believed that his father must have felt his role as a sorcerer was complete But the argument with Yuji well it goes a lot deeper For instance what if Iori tampered with Yuka and is actually the cause of her brain cancer We know in the sequel Mahito still exists and appeared in chapter 7 Hes waiting on the other side for Yugji or from what we can tell someone in particular Mahito prays on human insecurities to accommodate his goals to the point where his victims go against any common sense But you may be wondering how can Mahito even be contacted Well there is an area where he resides Even Kenjaku showcased this before the culling game a rift between reality and dreams where he contacted players Similarly Mahito did the same thing in chapter 271 Mahito meets Sukuna after his passing and tells him due to his innate ability he resides himself within the samsara cycle Hes in the pathway where souls walk And this means everyone who dies or comes to life can interact with him I mean even Yuka mentioned the cycle of rebirth before facing Darra connecting the plot even more Now Mahitos technique it could have unlocked the 10 shadows in Yuka After all Sukuna revealed that cursed techniques reside in the preffrontal cortex in the brain against Gojo So if I truly believe that the next generation needed to be stronger at any cost its not hard to imagine him searching for a solution for his childrens defect that would be in his eyes Yukas brain damage could be the result of her father doing a binding vow by making a deal with the devil himself to get what he wanted Especially when you look at chapter 6 there is no solution for Yukas cancer No understanding of whats going on and they havent even heard of this illness before And that could be because Mahito affected the soul which makes sense of everything Remember that Kenjaku used idol transfiguration on a massive scale to start the culling game He targeted people who already had dormant curse techniques but lacked the brain structure to use jiujitsu He literally rewired their brains so their techniques could awaken such as Higuruma And in the end Is argument with Yugji and him saying it doesnt matter It could be our boy telling him what he thinks is wrong And his children being the way they are shouldnt matter to him Because Yuji once said to Sukuna after all we were born with the burden of a curse Even if no one else accepts it hes willing to go on living with him So Is role should be to nurture his kids with what was given rather than pushing an ideal onto them by force And guess what people this makes perfect sense And the writing is amazing because this generational trauma connects to Maru Well lets not forget that hes an inverse of Surigis situation And thats Gays way of showing how curses come in all forms Marus curse is having a present father who left him religious ideals that haunt him with an obsession while Sudigis is having an absent father who left him with scars and curiosity So people are missing the point with Marus ideal to be a warrior It makes way more sense when you see what the culture drilled into him because on their planet Lumerian women cant wield cursed energy so their men have to be warriors by default Their jiujutsu is literally framed as a gift from the gods And real men protect women and children because they cant bear the burden So Maru is trying to be worthy of a holy title his whole society worships Thats why he cant back down on Sugiris challenge and hes not going to give up on the 50000 refugees on the ship But lets not forget Yugji is slowly becoming the only answer to all the problems Yuka is already in a state of suspended death The ritual would not end unless Darra is killed or Maharaga is destroyed If either of those things happened Yukas death is guaranteed This parallels what happened to Megumi in chapter 117 But Sukuna used RCT to save him However thats not the only time we have seen someone be saved from death It happened to Yugji twice First when Sukuna ripped his heart out and then revived him and later when UT killed him and used RCT to bring him back All of this links to a huge plot point fans believe will happen Yugji is going to save the day by helping Yuka live and taking on Darura or Mahuraga depending on the outcome This would parallel Sukunas fuga moment perfectly as Yuji would form a height moment and aura by displaying his new powers immediately upon arrival I still believe that Marus harmony technique can also come into play to locate Yugji because Sukunas finger is still holding up a barrier and that can be used to resonate with his essence to find Yugji anywhere in the world to help humanity That would fit the writing of his character development to believe in coexistence and peace again putting aside his obsession and curse to be a warrior Like bro Im going to crash out if Yuji got hyped this much and doesnt appear once in this sequel Gay literally drew how prime Yuji looks like And its its depressing Look at his eyes Hes looking around 20 years old and more like his uncle Sukuna Give him a break Give him a hypora moment You know what Im saying And at this point Yuji understands something most sorcerers never will The world is in a balance When Gojo was born the world responded by creating stronger special grade curses right And when Sukuna rose humanity was forced to produce monsters of its own just to survive where they all became special grade So when Yuji says it doesnt matter how strong sorcerers are hes implying that chasing strength is meaningless because the jiujitsu system will always find a way to correct itself The wheel will never stop turning And thats why in the sequel I think Yuji wants to break it Hes searching for a plan to eliminate curse energy altogether Just like Yuki was researching in the original manga she believed the only way to end curses was by eliminating its source She identified that curse energy is produced by humans through negative emotions right Which means killing curses is only a temporary fix because new ones will always be born And Yuji has been witnessing this for six bloody decades This also ties directly into Yujis own problem of being immortal Yugji wants to die and he wants a good death surrounded by friends without regrets And to do that he needs to break the wheel with the others just like Yuka and Cross promised to each other and bloody mention Chapter 17 then picks up the fight between friends immediately Marus technique of chaos and order disrupting physics has Surigi on the back burner He doesnt understand the technique yet and almost falls off a building He cant even get close Maru then immediately jumps in to stab and is launching him all over the building like a play toy But eventually he figures out a counter and makes both of them lose their swords But as they race to pick them up they clash once again However Sugiris sword is caught between Marus blade trapping him inside using his physical strength against him With that he busts him outside and they have a chat midair before the final blow Sugiri thinks to himself that he might have won And even if there was a 1 chance that Yuka can be saved then he would always bet on that just like Maru would for his own cause Now this beautifully connects to another plot point from the original manga that you cannot forget Remember that Kjaku stated life is a gamble and people who do not take a step in action whilst looking at death in front of their eyes they are absolutely detestable Even Hakari believe that everyone in life gamles on something This is their fever of trying to change things in some way But the true manner of dealing with this fever is by gambling He thinks that society tramples on people who cant bet big enough meaning people who cant take chances to progress their goal This is something even Gojo mentioned to Uta whilst they were training mentioning the fever once again So this is something that we find Cross Yuka and Sugiri doing right And it will tie into how they will make Maru have a change of heart to gamble on coexistence once again since his ass is about to get beaten into a pole Because although Sugiri gets completely destroyed multiple cars thrown at him explosions a whole ass building collapsing and dashed into the ground If this dude was any other human without heavenly restriction then he would have been finished Now the look of despair on Marus face tells it all Obviously my guy doesnt want his friend to suffer by his hands and he doesnt want to kill him But Marus love for his brother and his duty as a warrior supersedes everything However Sugiri is not done He thinks about his fathers ideology of valuing strength and power He accepts that being born great and having a great death is something to be proud of But he cant accept that way of thinking Like Yuji who told Sukuna how every life and memory is precious He thinks that even if a persons life is ordinary and vague As long as their everyday existence was out there then that was enough This testament is a reference to his father who saw himself as trash became depressed and then disappeared Now at this moment Udas ring on his neck starts glowing Cursed energy floods out Sugiri thinks his grandpa is here but no its the queen of curses Ra She disappointedly tells him how takes after Maki calling her that woman reminding us how Ra was obsessed with UT and was jealous of Mari that she ended up with him marrying smashing all that good    Now I do want to mention that this panel right here oh my god hypeora moment Absolutely fire screaming Now eventually they form a contract and because of Uthers requests and their undying love Ria was told to help the progeny of his bloodline So she does just that and tells Sugiri to accept the deal And with one word he becomes a special grave Just like we had predicted he has become one of the strongest sorcerers to exist Though he doesnt have a full restriction like Oji and Mari his body is insanely strong And now with RAs immense curse energy reserve he has become completely broken Ra merges with his body showing us a new transformation we havent seen And before Maru can blink twice and say anything questioning who this new challenger is Ra gives him a quick write sending the Samrian flying busted all open Now remember one of Rs ability is curse technique storage So whatever UT probably copied is probably still in there So he has access to all of that now too And theres also the cursed tool storage which has all these special grade weapons sitting inside of her So he is completely busted and we cannot even fathom what the hell is going to happen next Now everything is adding up Sugiri will defeat Mu now and convince him that with RA now back they can use RCT on cross and save it Remember Ra was able to use positive energy to heal UT And in chapter 269 it was absolutely an insane feat because he explained how Ra was able to heal and even sustain his dead ass body whilst his brain wasnt in it Now currently the level of RCT the Jutsu sorcerers have is weak In the sequel in chapter 13 the healer literally called herself trash while she was trying to heal Usami and Cross But with Ra things have now changed Not only can she heal Cross but even Yuka Remember that this fight is happening before Mahur Raga and Darra which means once this is over they will still have time to save her We cant forget that theres another option for these people The Samrians can manage the Kalan in Tokyo and will be allowed to reside there which was an option that they had And with the condition that no curse can leave the vicinity its a winwin for both parties Ra is also a Kalano member according to them since shes a cursed spirit Imagine she kills another cursed spirit in front of them Theyre going to be thinking Wait a second Why is Kalan killing Kalan And then theyre going to question their beliefs and realize Wait a second the humans were telling the truth This is something else Another point to make is that Sugiri directly parallels Megumi who failed to save his own sister These two characters mirror each other but their outcomes diverge Now to enjoy more Peak Fiction watch this video about

        "plain_text": "Hello chosen ones Welcome to the channel Today I have a message for some of us that is pretty specific So just ask God about it But the message is you are the coldest chosen one So its definitely specific because not all the people who are in a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ who have like sold their soul out to God to where theyre being used in the kingdom of God in big ways Theyre major players out here in the spiritual warfare thats happening Not all of you guys are meant to be cold Not all of us are meant to have this um specific part of our personality You know its its its its only for a specific group of the chosen ones out here And so but the message is that you are the coldest Okay So you have some kind of part of your personality that is ice cold it is Um you might have been called cold before People might have told you like Damn youre cold Or you might have just had moments where you realized like Damn Im cold Or something something is like kind of dead inside with me or somethings very cold you know And um you know the ironic thing is that for some of us for most of us who this is for you were actually born as like the most empathic You were born as like the most loving most compassionate the most sensitive the most emotionally just um driven and and open with your love and just very compassionate and sensitive and empathic And you especially are very compassionate toward animals and children And you were able to sense very you know compassionate uh empathic souls that were also out there that you would feel all of this uh strong sense of love for But something happened to where it was just either ingrained in your personality for you to just become colder and colder as you grew up because of just the way that your brain was built And then for some God had to let you go through experiences that totally sh changed your personality that completely transformed you into somebody who is extremely cold And so there are a lot of reasons for this but one of them is that for some youre supposed to go very very far in this reality and to to deal with people from a very high place And you just have to be extremely cold to be able to make it in a high place like that You have to be able to deal with sharks and like the worst of the worst kind of people the most brutal types of coldest types of coldblooded people ever So you have to be able to um be at the same level with these people And so God is saying that you have actually come through a completion where you are the coldest You are colder than any coldblooded Mcavelian dark triad personality type out here that uh you can be more coldblooded than that person um than a full than a fullblown like uh you know Satanist or somebody who is um you know even trying to be dead inside or trying to be the coldest You are naturally colder than they are because of your calling and because you have followed God through whatever experiences that you were meant to go through to become this person and to have this gift So you have been given this gift of of being able to be ice cold Its almost inhuman how cold youre able to be You can go through situations that other that would terrify other people that would make other people extremely uncomfortable that they wouldnt be able to handle it because you just have to be so coldblooded to get through that kind of a situation And because you are who you are now that that God has changed you you are able to go into these situations that other people wouldnt be able to to get into Okay So but God is saying that you know um this is part of what is going to bring you into your destiny and its a major part of what you had to become in order to get there But that it doesnt make you any less of a person who loves God It doesnt make you any less of Gods child because you are still that loving empathic sensitive compassionate person on the inside and you still have this heart that is so soft for certain people But um you you know are only going to show that to innocent beings you know to beings that are not evil that deserve it and that this is a part of Gods calling for your life and that youre meant to be this way And some people might try to demonize you for being such a coldblooded person sometimes And God is saying that when that happens you have to remember that no actually this is Gods gift to me because he wanted me to be able to go very far and to deal with the coldest of the coldblooded per people out here And this is my gift that Gods given me for survival Okay And I am just also getting that you know some of some of us might think that were too cold to ever be able to find a person who like is a partner or to find that you know spouse or whatever because were just too cold blooded I got to say that he has already set you up with somebody who is just very similar as you to where you guys are going to understand the coldness of each other Its uh going to be something very very familiar between the two of you okay Where youre just going to have a very deep understanding of why you are the way you are and who you actually are on the inside behind this mask of coldness So but Im going to go ahead and pull some cards but Im just getting that you know for some of us you have come through a major completion Im just seeing the world that you have gone through a major healing process um where years and years and years of you experiencing the worst of the worst kinds of situations with the worst of the worst types of people has all come together into this uh season of healing where you have just um absorbed everything and youve uh allowed God to just filter everything through uh in in in a way to where this coldness has been purified and and and you just um you are experienced on a whole another level Okay So Im just getting that you are now ready to be in any room with um any type of person and you could be surrounded by a whole bunch of sharks You could be surrounded by the most uh terrifying like you know attorneys or just I dont know the types of personalities that are so intimidating Whereas before you might have just come into a room like this and and you might have felt like they get to call all the shots like they get to make all the decisions theyre higher than me theyre better than me you know theyre just the these people are cutthroat or whatever But because you are who you are now you can go into these types of rooms and know that no actually Im the coldest    here Um and it dont make me any less of a chosen one that I am the most coldblooded    here And it dont make me any less of a coldblooded    because I have this facade or I have this uh you know natural personality of kindness and compassion and empathy And I might show that to you once in a while but that dont mean that um that I aint more cutthroat than you are or that that uh that Im scared of you in any way because I am the coldest person here So this is a gift that God has given you that could only have been received through your faithfulness in following the Lord Jesus Christ beyond church and beyond religious fear Okay because you have stepped out into the darkness where God really called you to and you uh you did not listen to these religious people who tried to stop you and now you are the coldest    out here and you are going to uh to step into rooms where your uh your gift of coldness is going to save you You will be able to survive because of this Yeah you are the coldest    out here Okay listen They they dont they dont see they dont see whats going on behind your facade because some of you just have the cutest facade Okay But uh youve actually youve come up against the devil himself The devil himself has uh tried to to murder you Okay The devil himself has been after you trying to unalive you for so long that you are uh you are you are a beast Okay You are worse than any kind of a dark triad personality out here You have dealt with the worst kinds of personalities out here Some of you have dealt with murderers and stalkers and psychopaths and sociopaths and demonpossessed people who were trying to unal alive you who were doing meth all the time and becoming possessed in regards to you You have dealt with the the like worst of the worst out here This is the worst of the worst out here See this is uh this is trying to unalive someone relentlessly because you are demonpossessed All right And it turned you into this cold uh into this ice cold ice queen or king who uh with the king of swords okay Who is just you are uh I dont know how to say it but but aint nobody getting nothing past you All right And if they do its an accident and and uh its not going to happen twice I dont know how to explain this but uh yeah you were unimpressed All right You dont care if somebody uh tries to intimidate you or comes at you acting like theyre cold and that they can uh you know have that that that they can do something to you Youre like No no    I I am not interested Ive seen it all I know that um Im colder than you All right I know whats up I can see beyond this situation because I am really ice cold and I am not phased by your coldness I am not phased at all Okay So God has made you unfazed by these types of uh of of dark and evil personalities because some of you are going to be dealing with big bosses out here These are big big big bosses big big corporations that are filled with sharks All right And youre going to be coming in there with looking like new money All right Youre youre coming into very highlevel positions Some of us are stepping into this right now and you are going to be the new money Youre going to be looking like youve got a whole fruit basket on your head energetically and youre going to be surrounded by sharks who want to steal it Um and and these will be very strong people all right With very big contracts and you will be um you will be able to absolutely know what it is Youre going to know damn well who you are Youre going to know that cant nobody take anything from you Youre going to be the coldest person and totally unimpressed by any kinds of uh intimidation and uh youre not afraid to slow things down and youre not afraid to uh to wait and be patient And God is just saying that you have come to a completion of your training All right And youre ready and youre youre youre taking off into these places All right And youre going to be the coldest    there Even though you might also be the nicest person there Yeah because you you uh you kept getting up You allowed God to take you through experiences that tore you open that tore you apart that completely broke your heart into billions of pieces and you continued to uh to follow God and to do what he said All right And you got colder and colder and colder okay And and and smarter and smarter and smarter and uh more block happy You uh you learned how to block people like instantly like you dont give a damn about nobodys feelings All right If if you catch the first sign of somebody being an op you dont give a damn about their feelings anymore from that point and you block them All right And um yeah Oh my god So this has just brought you into the place of um of major destiny of being able to receive everything that is coming in without uh without losing your head without losing your energy um you are just ready because its about to go down in a huge way and actually another thing is that you know youre suddenly going to be connected with with a spouse and this is going to be someone who again God has created for you Its somebody who is similar to you They know your coldness and they they understand that that that isnt actually who you are in your heart that thats who your flesh is because you have to be this person But in your heart they theyre going to know um theyre going to know who you are and you guys are going to have like the most epic relationship because of this All right Its going to be a very deep intimate relationship that only you guys understand each other All right Its going to be very much filled with joy and happiness and brightness All right And this is going to be a wish a major wish come true But that you know this is also having to do with your career because these people are going to respect you because of who you are because of what youve been through because theyre uh you know theyre going to see that you know within the first within the first few minutes of getting to know you that you are this person that God has has created you to be a very cold a very intelligent and uh a very unafraid person All right And thats just going to that thats going to suddenly get you uh a massive amount of success All right Yeah So let me just pull a couple more cards and see I did uh have the sign of Leo and Aries Yeah but this is going to bring you so much success All of these betrayals and everything that youve been through has turned you into somebody who is able to handle literally anything the worst of the worst kinds of pains or situations or anything And you are taking off now Uh you you youre about to find massive success because of this Okay So yeah this is why God has allowed you to go through all these pains Okay So Im going to leave it there Im also seeing Virgo and Gemini But um I hope this

external make sure you are proclaiming that over your experience and your relationships You are attracting in magnetically in this time All that of which that you are and all that you have integrated which for many of you if not all of you is years upon years upon years or lifetimes upon lifetimes upon lifetimes of currents ofqi uh lower vibrational corrupted darker energy that you have alchemized into light prosperity unconditional love They said faded and highly fortunate events Oo spirit coming through early And yes we are here early What is up galactic golden Ohana We may be early for the next few days I feel like they said and you have ascended ear What I just heard you have ascended earlier than anticipated Get ready for the ball that is now rolling What is this ball that is now rolling Spirit we got three of swords Your enem is left heartbroken Two of cups because youre in a dynamic or youre about to be Emperor and death So some of you are not in a union yet Some of you are about to be leaving those that were working against your connections heartbroken because this is just the beginning for you This lets me know some of you are in a union right now and there was work being done against your union This is only deepening the bond Some of you do have a third party Youre not in a third party You have a third party Theres a ex that just wont leave you the    alone This ex could be a Scorpio could be an Aries could be a Gemini Libra Aquarius or a Pisces Cancer Does not have to be Take what resonates leave what doesnt But some of you you do have an ex out here Uh a counterfeit counterpart Could be a part of some occult or organization that is heartbroken because you never came back Whoever this is their seat or I wont say their seat has been taken but this contract void they feel as though their seat has been taken but they forfeited their seat when they came after you This is somebody because their life is falling apart They now want to come reconnect with you because of how well its going for you So some of you have an ex out here that knows you have either aligned with somebody new energetically and this persons coming through physically or you aligned with somebody new energetically A con a new divine contract has been stated and this individual is now in your life So with the ball the divine saying get ready The ball is rolling Some of you are about to have a very sweet serendipitous meeting with a person that is meant to be a part of your experience a part of the fate that is unfolding Its a joint mission a double mission Some of you also have friendships coming in I heard fame Some of you this may not be a romantic partnership at all This is you Aries energy You could be an Aries emperor energy you standing firm and remaining focused on continually elevating into your highest potential and knowing that everything will inevitably unfold in your highest favor And for some of you what is a part of this high highest favor your highest potential Uh the biggest mission your soul could have taken on here is fame So take what resonates leave what doesnt Cuz yall know Im not here to conform nor am I here to convince you Im just here to confirm what you already know So this very well could be individuals from your past attempting to stop you from being highly positively praised and recognized uh for your creative soul expression And I heard rising from the ranks Theyre also showing me a phoenix rising above or uh cult organized ranks a cult organized rank brotherhood sisterhood cult coven individuals that were supposed to be higher ranking than you The empress just came back out This could be your    mama Your mama could be some type of eastern star or something but thats irrelevant Whatever occult workings were being used against you in order for you to forfeit your fate and your destiny and keep you from rising through the ranks and stepping into your highest potential have completely shattered These individuals were under the illusion that they would be able to compromise uh your power compromise your light in order for it to be used for nef judgement immediately for nefarious intentions Its almost like these individuals intended on continually getting away with causing heart harm and injury to others by masking themselves in your energy And some of you this could have been a mother figure You could even have a father or stepfather that perceives themselves or proclaims themselves a 33 degree Freemason Whoever this is theyre not doing well Like your ex could be in some type of organization They could have worked with a karmic family    You could have a secret society on your ass Whoever this is or whatever group this is they are not doing well at all like mentally and healthwise especially directing you death I also heard if you resonated with my last reading you unbound an angel of death that was being manipulated Tell me a little bit more about this angel of death that has been unbound Because they just they just said that you have unbound an angel of death We got a prince of hearts and a missed opportunity What does this have to do with this angel of death The illusions the illusions and the endings from the bidding this angel had done have been undone So it seems like there was some type of conjure there was some type of entity that orchestrated endings not only in your lives but others Uh and it seems like individuals have awoken from this So we do have a prince of hearts Some of you may actually have individuals that want to apologize to you that know they missed the opportunity to apologize to you that dont even know why they betrayed you dont even know why they walked away from you why they hurt you uh why they were seeing you in a certain way but this was a binding done like is this a ex Who who was under this binding They said all those in your life that were seen in your energy as elevation So some of you had friendships I wont say some the majority of you in here had friendships and relationships that when they popped in your energy uh others that were doing divination on you are looking into your aosic records or astrological chart Were seeing that these relationships had potential to elevate you that there were good things that would come from these connections if you chose to ascend with each other And it looks like one of you or those that had come up against you uh in certain forms and fashions had been intentionally manipulated because of the way they were picked up in your energy But again all is divinely orchestrated These were tests to the hearts and spirits of those that were around you because like the butterfly effect there are many many choices we could make that would lead to different outcomes So the highest vibrational outcome uh of these connections would be if these individuals ascended if they had not been corrupted if they had not made the decision they did in order to betray you Now its left these individuals not only in depletion physically but energetically in anguish and having a lot of anxiety We got protection out here You have you were protected from these people that werent as strong as you And I dont mean to say that in an egotistical fashion What Im saying is these individuals with the test that you were faced with and the test that these individuals were faced with you could have chosen to be corrupted You could have chosen to move like those that came up against you but you chose the path of the straight and narrow You chose to be a good person when everything was giving you a reason to be a shitty person a evil just    You could have been out here just treating people the way that people have been treating you but you didnt You also werent compromised when it came to money I feel like some of you have received blessings in the past or maybe the recent or uh yeah the recent recent past or maybe a few years ago where instead of just being grubby with it you gave like you give somebody the shirt off your back Youre a very very sweet soul very kind very unconditionally loving heart Like you go out of your way to do things for others where others have not done these things for you And its not that you ever felt obligated or like you had to You just did it out of the kindness of your spirit where these individuals were eight of swords These individuals these sneaky deceptive individuals that are now out in the cold Look at them Five of pentacles are in their heads about what they should have and theyre watching you What they could have should have and would have done I heard they didnt have the strength to walk in your shoes You walked through fire and still had divinity in your heart You should be proud of yourself with this finish line This is the completion of all of these previous karmic contracts that were placed within your souls reincarnation uh cycles as assignments to get you to elevate And this has been completed But like I said you do have these individuals in the background working relentlessly and tirelessly to shift you out of alignment to what is unfolding as we speak Its like they can sense excuse me I was corrected Not its like they know They know and they can sense that you have walked into destiny that theyre that youre at this finish line or youve crossed this finish line and they want you so desperately to backtrack This is why spirits saying remain focused and continue to lock in on what you know is occurring in your reality and what you desire to experience within the coming months I also heard February is going to be a very big month for you January I feel like its going to be you organizing sorting things out pertaining to your new life and starting to get accustomed and adjusted to your new life And February is going to be the month where the divine again take what resonates leave what doesnt For those of you this is for where the divine accelerates what youve become adjusted to which means more abundance more love more recognition for you Its like youre ready now but you are also Its like I need to Its like I keep saying that this is a life that youre really going to like And they also want me to stop saying its like because its not its like it is So excuse me Divinely corrected You are ready for this But again with the way things are moving physically January is going to be the month that you get accustom and you adapt and you adjust to the changes that have been integrated to the changes that are unfolding and to the ways that your routine uh has completely shifted Some of you may even be guided to get back in the gym uh in order to raise your frequency and vibration Some of you have been guided to shift your eating habits Some of you could even be purging like my skin is purging right now Uh and I know with every skin purge that I have especially with how bad it is um it indicates like the release of things that are not following me into this new year and a massive ascension I have completed So some of you if not all of you could be experiencing things pertaining to your skin Your scalp could be itchy Your skin is purging too Dont even stress about it Let it happen Let your skin purge Let your body get acclimated to this new timeline with the way that it is caught up to your spirit You could also be experiencing body aches uh weird dreams These dreams could also signify what you are releasing or the cycles that have been closed out With the moon here and the king of swords this is a complete severing of ties to those that needed your energy in order to elevate And this is why your enemies are so obsessed with finding a way to not only attach to you but misalign you to cause chaos and disruptions in your reality So youre more focused on the negative and manifesting more of the negative than you are what you should be focused on which is your brand new start your brand new life your brand new beautiful relationships and this big ass bag of abundance thats coming through I heard Gods going to do it for you I dont know what you prayed for recently in the last 3 days but your prayers have been heard and they have been answered Im hearing specifically if you asked for a uh for a monetary blessing This is coming through for you But just know that there are going to be things within the matrix thrown your way an unexpected    bill uh an unexpected expenditure thats going to try and shift your vibration from the abundant alignment that you have been in perceiving yourself as being a magnet to monetary means to doubting dismay distortion uh disempowerment and poverty lack mentality So just be aware do in a sense the matrix is going to test the matrix the simulation organizations network societies corrupted groups are going to attempt to test how strong your frequency and your vibration is So do not allow what is meant to mentally entrap you in a certain timeline or in a certain frequency Uh I also hearing high frequency weaponry Do not allow what is meant to entrap you in a certain timeline or frequency to adhere Now with the moon and the king of swords we do have Pisces heavily on the board We have Gemini Libra Aquarius heavily on the board You could be a Gemini Libra Aquarius You could be a Pisces but individuals understand what they dont see And what I mean by that is with the moon intuitively these individuals are picking up that these ties have been severed Not only are they intuitively picking up but because they cannot restore Im hearing restoration restore what is falling apart They know that there has been a permanent reclamation of your power Theres been a permanent severing of ties This is also causing a lot of arguments and conflict within this group where they had at one time bonded against you They had recruited and they had grouped up in order to continually defame and smear your name to keep you from experiencing certain opportunities they knew uh were meant to unfold if you had reached a certain alignment Now with the king of swords energy this is also getting Archangel Michael in the dream state with the moon being out here Your angels are alerting you to what may be directed towards you so you can prepare to intake it necess intake it and apply it as necessary And Im also getting you may have recently called on Archangel Michael You are being protected not only in your dream state but from what you cannot see And this is individuals Give me one on this King of Pentacles cuz I was going to say these are individuals that feel like they can find a vulnerable moment or put you in a vulnerable position to where youre easily emotionally manipulated into a lower vibration so that you dont walk into 2026 as the highest vibratory aligned angelic energy as your highest Oh yep There it is Thank you Archangel Michael I cant make this    up The angel said uh reverse on this tower Whats behind this tower Six of pentacles So you are being protected with the king of pentacles out here If you are with a counterpart this counterpart is going through ascension just as you are Or they may have just completed out their ascension You could be with an individual right now or you have this individual in your energy who was being relentlessly targeted but subconsciously angelically guided to alchemize this energy A tower has reversed that was meant to stop not only you from receiving what is unfolding before you but to keep you from receiving an offer or to keep your counterpart in a financial burden to where that was supposed to stress yall out So if you are with uh a counterpart or when you get with a counterpart your relationship will be tested or your again your frequency and your vibration will be tested because these individuals they argue over money They think money is the end all be all I feel like you if you are with somebody uh as you are alchemizing this energy you may have some some bumps along the road You may have um a little bit of financial like upheavalss like I said an unexpected expenditure a bill that pops out of nowhere but yall will handle it with grace This will not cause upheavalss in your relationship or this will not cause upheavalss in your life uh pertaining to or yeah pertaining to how you handle this So if youre not with somebody or if youre not open to a relationship this could very well be these individuals that paid to cause financial upheavalss to you in order to again shift you out of this very positive high vibrationally abundant alignment because they dont Its like they want you to take these old cycles with you into your new year And the divine is like No leave that here Thats not going with you You cant take that with you You better not take that with you So Archangel Michael and angelic energies working relentlessly here against those that are trying to orchestrate a tower Having this tower reverse onto those your enemies who are just oppressed depressed and stressed and pressed Looks like they been out of shape Look they been out of shape out here because you do have this fools energy which is about a new beginning Its also about a leap of faith A leap of faith into the new The fool card is zero being at zero point master manifestation energy I also power play I also just got a notification that said power play So this lets me know you are a very powerful player and its giving checkmate    This is how youre leaving 2025 isanara good riddens everything that was a part of Im hearing from 2018 for some of you uh to to now 2025 where all of these cycles all of these assignments all of these karmic energies just got moed They just got checkmated and theyre out here relentlessly Im getting for some of you a maternal figure as well as an ex or a paternal figure as well as an ex working tirelessly and relentlessly in order to attach to you before you walk into 2026 cuz Im getting this portal Im getting you are walking through this portal and as soon as you do this this 2026 portal it is something about 2026 this new year as soon as you walk through something as soon as a test comes through and you passed it that cycle closes that portal closes behind you thats what Im getting you got individuals attempting to attach to your look at this your justice your dharma your celebration people from six of cups your past who were living their best lives off of distorting your energy affecting your progress and again keeping you from elevating by instigating and uh provoking certain emotional upheaval certain emotional reactions that youre no longer having because youre not the you that they knew Ooh bars Youre not the you that they knew They dont know how to trigger you Two of Pentacles and we got Ace of Cups Your cup overflowth highly favored extremely fortunate favor fa uh uh fortune favors the bold type of energy I dont know Im getting this very weird in the background insidious spiteful envious vibe And I feel like from those that again they they made bad deals but it you were like used as bait They made very bad deals There was collateral if this deal over your life fell through and it did because it was never going to be you They were unable this karmic family thats under judgment Told you I was feeling this insidious    judgment with this 10 of cups You were the one that brought all of this judgment down upon these individuals that can no longer cloak themselves or protect themselves in your energy Or this is your exs karmic family Somebodys whole household is up in in flames fire This is why your enemies are so stressed Again theyre watching you experience this beginning that they had continuously siphoned and sacrificed pertaining to you in order to have this come up in order to be seen as abundant in order to heal And now while your dream life has become your reality their worst nightmare has been made real What do we need to know about this energy Because it again your wheel of fortune is here Youre at the finish line of something massive and it is leading to so many phenomenal miraculous supernatural events in your experience But the when it comes to your enemies it looks like everything every    thing is going wrong Everything that could go wrong is going wrong And theyre trying to direct that wrong and project that wrong over you So again if theres a little bit like its giving lemony snick series of unfortunate events if you have like little small    trying to piss you off dont let it This is these are projections This isnt even your energy I feel like the divine may be letting this through uh slightly just to test you We got eight of wands communication coming out sideways block communication a decision two of swords Give me one on this block communication and this decision source God what do we need to know about this queen of swords keep these cuts made thats what the divine wants you to know there is a lover that may try to uh appro you already know this you could have been having dreams of this person or if this is not a lover these were individuals that should have loved you where things are going    wrong and they cant attach to you and they cant project this ending over you you need to know with those that are faced with defeat and that are being forced to surrender theyre going to try and make themselves known to you They are going to try and reach out They are going to try and communicate Spirits saying Keep these cuts made Theres a reason why you have been guided to block communication with certain people Could even be a Leo out here Somebodys being exposed for the things they said about you too and why they made the decision to go up against you I told you with this angel of death that has been unbound Uh there were necessary endings that occurred in your life where others had again mistaken not mistaken were misguided and misled about you These may be the individuals that now want to apologize because theyre like I dont know why I did what I did to you and Im so sorry You are not obligated in any way shape and form to accept that apology or to hear these people out Honestly with the way communication is coming through uh in this deck spirits saying keep communication blocked with the decisions you made to cut communication off from certain individuals Keep it that way because theyre not allowed to be a part of whats unfolding for you And they were out here collaborating I cant make this    up Look at this three of pentacles Thats a collaboration We got the prince of wands out here They moved quickly to collaborate against you with the magician So if you were wondering if certain individuals that are now left in remorse and regret were doing some type of huby jubilee over you or if they knew some type of huby jubilee was being done over you some type of    hocus pocus voodoo magic Oh I would say voodoo madness That was not a coincidence Yes Yes they were They were out here manifesting against you Some of you you have exes that are    Satanist bro some type of a cult They was playing in something dark They thought it was funny too Somebody out here maybe this was a sibling but somebody out here felt like the darker occult was amusing like it was some type of aesthetic and they were playing in some dark    they didnt fully understand and bound themselves to And this is why theyve been permanently released from you because they was playing in some weird    And now because their life is falling apart and whatever they were playing with is destroying their life they want to come over to you Dont dont unblock them Let your wheel of fortune unfold as it should Oh Jesus Yeah I know They was playing in some dark    Look at this Your ancestors said we fighting the devil right now These do not let these individuals back into your life especially with how beautiful it is how beautiful its about to be Cuz your ancestors said these know that they are the devil This is who they was playing with This is what they was involved in Ebuke Give me one on the seven of wands with the devil spirit Eight of you walk the    away Yes Spirits saying keep your distance from these individuals Whether its family exlovers old friends anybody from your past is meant to remain in the past Its not meant to be a part of your future And theyre really adamant about this So you may very well have some people that like need you right now that have the audacity to reach out after everything theyve done to you and everything they said about you It is giving Yes John It is giving house a sellouts What else do we need to know about this wheel of fortune and the phenomenal beautiful expansive experiences that are spirit says thats the truth You already know this These beautiful expansive experiences we can expect to unfold with the Ace of Swords and the High Priestess Youre also about to find out the truth Hold on Ill get into this Wheel of Fortune uh and the 2026 energy in a minute But theyre so serious about this Like theyre not playing The divine is stating these individuals made intentional deals Were intentionally playing in the graveyard Were intentionally conjuring and doing like little Theyre showing me somebody prick their thumb and like put it in something like intentionally doing things in order to work with something darker in order to get a certain outcome like they really expected like the devil to bring them fame fortune luck favor but its something about your name was written in blood or some    Like you were meant to be the the biggest sacrifice and you got away which compromised all of their previous contracts All of their previous contracts were void because they couldnt get you So you these individuals were like intentionally diabolical nefarious and evil What the hell What was they playing in Oh yeah they was evil Queen of cups in the reverse Oh they didnt feel sorry about this They wanted these They wanted a good life And this was off you being sacrificed Thats crazy These are some evil energies with the Queen of Cups in the reverse They didnt feel any type of way about you not being here or something bad happening to you continuously or your babies your households like they really held no feelings towards what they were doing They just needed it to work And now its a new year Its a new day Its a new life for you And youre about to be feeling real good You could like Michael Boué because your hard work has paid off And theres the Wheel of Fortune Youre at the top of the wheel and again at an alltime high energetically Everything is being magnetized to you in this moment You are literally walking into this new year as this new version of you with this new experience that is unfolding And again January is about you getting accustomed and adapted and acclimated to all of the new that has aligned for you and that is physically unfolding for you And again this may be slightly uncomfortable The first month of January or the first month the first month of the new year may be slightly uncomfortable with how you are having to get adjusted and the things that you are going to be guided to change or relinquish in the next few days into January And this could be even bad habits like this could be you you know slowing down your sugar intake or you cutting back on caffeine or you changing from eating fried greasy foods to something healthier and more uh high frequency and high vibrational for your system So this is going to take some getting used to this the way that you walk now the way that you talk the way that you are And its going to take time for others to get used to this new version of you as well because youre going into this new year as a new you a you that nobody has had access to except those that are meant to be around you So yes make sure that youre taking your salt baths youre doing your cleansing Uh you may even want to do a return to sender of intent and entities just to clear out any residual unnecessary energy and intentions before 2026 What else do we need to know Spirit you want me to get the Ganesha deck for show You have a Leo thats holding on to you or these individuals You do have enemies out here that are holding on to the thought that they would be able to disrupt distort or take from you if it Yeah Ace of Pentacles If its not a Leo its somebody that like they cant believe that its over Like they cant believe that you really escaped that youre really this protected with the Princess of Swords Theyre watching waiting praying doing practitionary work or paying for practitionary work Whose crusty ass is this Hold on Let me find out Lets be a little nosy real quick cuz I need to know who is still    attacking the collective I I just heard those that will not listen no matter how bad it gets for them continue to move forward leaving them in the past while you skyrocket into the future Let me see a little bit cuz we got time Somebody that wants to win by any means necessary and they watching you Who is this How many Can you give us a number Four balance for oh four balance four of cups balance missed opportunity to balance things out with you This is also individuals are fighting you and relentlessly targeting you and attempting to do whatever they can in order to obtain off your energy because they need balance in their lives I told you everything is going all right with the four of cups Theyre missing opportunities back to back to back Their life is going through upheavalss as yours is balancing out So why are they attacking you Why are they targeting you For balance Ooh this came out sideways Theyre blocked from your people from your past are blocked from your destiny Six of cups This beginning and your ancestors Your ancestors are blocking these individuals from your destined and faded beginning With the star out here this is not just about healing This is about destiny with the new or with the beginnings card which is the fool card card zero out here and your ancestors fighting these individuals They are foolish to continually attempt to combat you for what had been faded to unfold for you at this point in time Any adversity that you have is being handled immediately So youre not feeling the brunt of what they had intended you to go through And thats because angels and ancestors are all around you They are not allowing any of this to have effect on you because of where youre at vibratorily and what they need you to focus on What do you need us to f Well I was just about to ask what you need us to focus on what theyre telling us We got 88 out here walking away from everything that does not serve you and is not meant to be a part of your experience as well as what youre walking into This is what spirit wants you focused on is this fortune this abundance Im getting a big monetary blessing You prayed for life to change for the better You did the work in order to align with this positively abundant timeline And now your spirit team and the most high are communicating to you Be ready for the changes that you prayed for because they are happening now And again 88 you could be seeing 888 808 or 88 You got abundance bro They said inheritance unlocked Inheritance unlocked We got a king of staves out here Give me one on this king of staves We got a temptation This is why This is why you also have an ex working against you We got temptation with the King of Wands Bad deals were made This you got individuals that feel like they shouldnt have blocked away from you or a union This is also somebody that wants to lure you back in because you have your inheritance your ancestral divine inheritance unlocked which is leading to a massive monetary windfall in your life Whoever this is that you were associated with uh at one point in time they know with the way that their life is falling apart and the ways that yours is getting better that its only a matter of time before you have some type of very successful breakthrough very successful Im getting like blow up and glow up So some of you could be online This could be pertaining to something uh social med pertaining to something that you do on social media or that you post online or that youre like a business and somebody knows that youre about to be very very very successful I dont know why they just they just showed me Tony Stark and I believe as Iron Man he was uh not only a genius but a billionaire This is your justice So you got individuals that know we got another eight on the board Theyre mentally entrapped because their ships are being laid to rest because of the sacrifice they tried to do over you This could be a Pisces Cancer Scorpio Leo Aries Sagittarius Doesnt have to be While youre getting everything thats due to you So I dont know what type of comeup your ex had or what type of comeup your family had or whoever was working against you but that was very shortlived Very shortlived And now theyre realizing that everything that they thought they were going to be able to maintain everything that they thought they were going to be able to permanently stabilize in their life as its falling apart theyve realized that youve reclaimed all that is yours and that every deal they made before you that your energy protected them from reaping the consequences of have now fallen upon their own heads and collateral is being taken Im hearing the devil has come to collect because the devil couldnt collect you Aint that better Yep Look at this They stressed about this little hooly jubily They did the moon Theyre stressed about their secrets too This could be a Pisces You also as a psychic intuitive a seer and oracle You have these individuals stressed because you always know what the    theyre doing and you know what theyre going through Spirit is giving you a birds eye of your enemies letting you know every move they intend to make and every move they have made and every move that they may be currently making in order to prepare yourself from what you are going to integrate what you are going to take in and what you are going to be redirecting We got magic out here and fortune They really thought this was going to lead them to fortune Now they got to watch you get it Look at this You got ships coming in of wish fulfillment and fortune Then we got nine Look two nines on the board You could be seeing 999 909 or 999 Look at that They get to watch you movement right here They get to with the sun of the ace and the ace of pentacles and the two of cups Look at this spread Galactic golden They literally have to watch you be unconditionally loved Get this ace of pentacles that they wanted to hold on to that they wanted to be the one out here living with and watch you right off into what is seen as the sunset and the sunrise Its just the best days of your life 2026 going about to be lit You are protected Spirits saying Im making sure to coveret all of it And you get wish fulfillment You get to experience these ships that so many others were partaking in that are rightfully yours I dont know who got a job who got a relationship who got a house uh who got like a windfall who got cars off of compromising you but that is over whatever they the life they were living the celebration they were having the partys over now The party is over for your enemies They have to sit back and watch while its just beginning for you I think this is a beautiful reading because this is basically spirit saying youre

looks like Queen of Pentacles Princess of Pentacles Youre like evolving monetarily Going from a princess or a prince Im not saying that you are of course youre the empress Youre the emperor But monetarily there is something coming through empowering you Youre going from one way of life from experiencing life uh monetarily in a specific type of way in a way that did not align with your spirit to being empowered to having a massive windfall come through in the way that youve been locked in on this new alignment for you that leads to a massive I told you like business victory life victory This could be a victory in court What is coming through has been ordained by the most high for you But it is transformation lifechanging Youre going from overwork or working harder than I wont say the

endlessly in all the ways that God ordains and deems as necessary to your expansive highly impactful highly and positively impactful incredible phenomenal supernatural experience here And all those

all unfold for you expeditiously Seriously thank you Thank you for your likes Thank you for your comments Thank you for making this Galactic Golden Family what it is unconditionally loving and nonjudgmental and welcoming to all those that felt lost previously Because this family would not be a family without you So thank you because so many new Galactic Golden family members have located us and feel at home in this family And its all because of you I see yall talking to each other in the chat and in the comments just you know its almost like giving these other souls a sense of of wellbeing with the understanding because I know so many of us at many points in our journey felt    crazy And its so comforting to know theres so many of us that have had similar experiences That we truly are a galactic golden angelic collective that were meant to experience this so that wed be able to not only evolve ascend and elevate humanity but help Its like help the world understand what was meant to be cloaked what was meant to be hidden and illuminate it completely while also shining a guiding light to others who felt lost in the darkness So thank you for not only the beautiful energy youve directed my way but all those that you have saved along your journey and all those that youre about to with whats going to happen for you with whats about to happen for you Thank you And just know this beginning is big It puts you in a position to be You see how big this staff is and how the sun energy is behind it God is revealing you This is you A big energy but you have a bigger God Whatever is about to be done in your life its going to be seen by all And theyre going to know who backs you If they dont believe it theyre about to with whats about to be done for you Let me get my Ganesha cards and see what its your harvest I heard go big or go home Bit go big or go home Galactic Golden Ohana wish fulfillment Something really is Its big Hold on Let me Its big Can you give us a little bit of energy on this big phenomenal like beginning this 2026 Whats coming through Youre about to be generously given to The divines like What Im about to give you What did I just say So its what Gods about to do in your life I heard your ancestors and your angels prepared for this moment Youve been prepared for this moment but theyve been waiting for this Again divine timing So this is your ancestors and your angels going by any means necessary Keep this soul in alignment and make sure that everything unfolds when it is supposed to because time is here This is another reason why your spirit team is so adamant on on keeping people blocked not communicating with them releasing what is not of your highest vibrational good and staying focused on the future They said you never know how fast the future can happen for you but know that the future is now and everything is happening very quickly Stay focused Galactic Golden Ohana we got be candid So this is my sit down a little bit Whats being given to you is going to humble a lot of people This is sit down little    Be humble And this is also move in silence Now with this spread Im not getting that you you may be trying to move in silence with whats unfolding but whats about to be given to you is going to be so big that it is meant to be seen by your enemies It is meant to be revealed by the most high to all those that have attempted to oppress and oppose you because this is going to be humbling them Your enemy is about to be massively humbled I just heard they already are But whats about to be given to you is going to shut the mouths of many All right Bet What do we need to know Oh what do we need to know Inner knowing You already know this Imma shut Imma put this back in the deck I almost said shut this back in the deck Theyre shut out We got guidance with generosity but guidance in the reverse Your spirit teams saying they are not guiding you in any way shape or form to give to any    money over here thats being humbled So right off the bat just like we talked about earlier uh your spirit team is saying theyre going to come to you Your enemies will tell you whats going on They will need you So you could have somebody reach out of the blue and be I just went through this and I just went through that And theyre expecting you to be Oh my god do you need help Like do you need me to send you a few dollars or something No This is the divines way of showing you who had been uh opposing you who had been up against you and whos going through uh judgment See your spirit team with guidance in the reverse is not look at this with prosperity on the bottom Do not give to these people Do not give to these people You are not being guided to give them anything Which means this is coming in now Whatever is unfolding monetarily for you youre going to have well well more Well a well a well a wish Well more far more is what I meant to say Far more than you anticipated They said well more Like a well Its its its never ending Its a a a well of of fortune A well of wealth A wealth well Maybe some of you have a well outside or you recently saw some type of well but a well of wealth like you could give to these people and it wouldnt affect you It wouldnt it it wouldnt be a dent in your prosperity Youre not being guided to So you are going to have people that reach out that try and pull on your heartstrings because of what theyre going through Just know that your enemies they getting wrecked son They getting riggedy wrecked son because this is what they manifested cultivation just landed on be humble They have to accept this is what they cultivated by being determined to direct energetic movement your way This is for their soul to gain understanding while your life changes while you experience more joy and your harmony is unaffected So you have individuals in a lot of disharmony a lot of chaos sickness health poverty Well your life is stabilized Your beautiful abundant harmonious unconditionally loving extremely prosperous and highly favored and extremely fortunate life has stabilized This is your new beginning Youre being taken care of would nurture by the divine And your fulfillments are being met And not only met like wish fulfillments are being they said promises being fulfilled wish fulfillment coming to fruition Its protected as well by any means necessary I told you your spirit team is not playing about what they work so hard for you to experience This is giving You made it You really made it with drive here Im getting the chariot with this energy and the promise of the future Chariot energy Uh horse energy again 2026 fast fiery movement forward into what has been promised for you I told you a promise has been fulfilled with blessings at the bottom of the deck Blessings and love This is others Stay open to this This is others showing you unconditional love This is you loving your life and yourself This is you loving everything that unfolds for you and every relationship that youve been faded to make and every way that you skyrocket and are uh uh positively praised and recognized I dont know if somebodys eating like a strawberry strudel or like a strawberry cheesecake or something Strawberries could be very relevant I just smelled it I just smelled like a strawberry strudel or a strawberry cheesecake Strawberries Harvest Harvest energy You could have just recently eaten strawberries as well You could have seen a strawberry Just take what resonates leave what doesnt cuz yall know they be channeling me very interesting things Claires sentience has been amplified So your spiritual sense could be upgrading You just made a strawberry cheesecake Thats confir Thats confirmation Youre making red velvet cookies and strawberry cheesecake in the middle What Everybody make a strawberry cheesecake and stuff If you ate strawberries this morning confirmation right there Harvest harvest harvest Exactly Cause if youve been seeing strawberries just know that this is for you You could have even Yes had a a strawberry smoothie They said strawberries hold a massive spiritual significance Look into it Hold on Theyre making me look this up Pause Because I know that strawberries symbolize abundance but they want me Strawberries A strawberry spiritual meaning is love purity and abundance love and passion purity and righteousness abundance and fertility perfection and humility healing and balance and magic and nature Wow Is that what you can expect your 2026 to be looking like Cuz you better claim it You could have been craving strawberries as well So that is the spiritual meaning of strawberries that Yep Insight The divine is giving us insight right now into 2026 Abundance fertility love righteousness purity peace comfort I know peace and comfort wasnt a part of the strawberries but when you eat them if you like strawberries when you eat them you just feel a sense of peace and comfort And thats what Im getting The divine is assuring that everything unfolds as it should pertaining to your purpose your future and your partnerships as well as the position Oh and he thank you They also reminded me strawberries indicate healing as well Thank you spirit I almost forgot that you are also healing You will be at your utmost healed state walking into 2026 Healing uh h they said having fully been repaired from the trauma you experienced within previous cycles What is coming through is healing for you but this is also about soul level healing Its not its not just about uh restorative healing to the things that had been perceivably lost along this journey but its also about what your spirit may have allowed itself to carry through the trauma that you experienced through the assignments and the contracts that you closed out So its a deep soul level healing priority It is a priority that sustenance It is a priority that you anchor in and ground for whats coming in quickly because it comes into stay Not just this healing but everything that was due to be res I almost said responded to the way the universe the way the most high the way your angels are responding to you and the way that this restoration and this rejuvenation is occurring for you Its like the divine is saying I need you prepared for how quickly this is all happening for how quickly things are moving    Some of you could be in a relationship and be like This is moving hella fast Like the divine is saying Embrace how quickly this moves Embrace how quickly the things that are meant to come in uh how quickly it comes in and how it is meant to stay I heard it I heard it again Its a new dawn Its a new day And Im feeling good So be prepared to experience the best that life has to offer because youve experienced the worst Relax Some of you also need some more rest You need to meditate Im also hearing relax as it all happens Relax as it all unfolds Oh okay Thank you The best up to The best up to now What does that mean The best up to the best Its up from here I just got an ad that said the best up to and then it said 40 off now So four union something you can hold on to with the four of pentacles four of swords Things being laid to rest Those being humbled have to sit down And what else am I missing Four of cups They missed an opportunity with you They missed an opportunity to be connected to whats being given to you Amplified by the zero 40 So four zero Four amplified by the zero Take what resonates leave what doesnt But what you need to relax and let all unfold that is happening very quickly is this beginning Weve got cleared out your energy Those that you cleared out your energy are watching this Just so you know the divine is going to make sure to flex on each and every one of your enemies For real they are going to have to sit down and be humble I heard and keep your name out of their mouth Who Damn I was about to I was ABOUT TO SAY WHO SAID THAT Those that love you We got capacity to love and prosperity The divine really is about to show up and show out in your life and youre about to massively move forward This is even some of you are going to be getting a new card A lot of people are going to have to shut up when it comes to you and what theyve even this could be a practitioner speaking over you Theyre going to have to shut up You get to it Yeah A practitioner and what theyre speaking over you spiritual practice Theyre going to have to shut up they going that somebodys gifts are being stripped and they are being silenced in the spirit for because youre being protected from spiritual practice and they were told to sit down So whatever is happening to them its because the divine is saying youre done And whats happening to you is I heard angelic assurance as well as what is what is necessary to be supernaturally provided at this time pertaining to your purpose and the plan over your life Those that keep attempting to speak endings or project endings will be and have been silenced Again Im getting theyre done So some of you do have a practitioner that could be actually getting silenced Like they could be snatched to the outer realms They could be kicked out of their whole    vessel for messing with you Cuz somebody is not going to be able to heal or have their gifts restored in the ways that the divine is going to be uh making sure they can never cause hurt harm and injury again to you or anybody else What else do we need to know Achievement Some of you are getting this gift too with achievement This is your ranking going up or this being added because you Im almost getting like Mortal Kombat Get over here This could have been a Scorpio that was targeting you Uh some of you are having this practitioner or these practitioners gifts being given to you because you outranked them You came up against them and you won and they ended up forfeiting their gifts to you Wow So just expect even more scary accurate intuitive hits to come through They said youre going to know immediately whats been given to you with what youre able to do or whats been amplified for you We got Splendor in the reverse wanted to land over here So this has nothing to do with you This is somebody at the bottom of the wheel of fortune This is somebody that the work they were doing over your wheel of fortune has reversed So you are having additives to your experience Yep Look at this Blessings I cant make this    up You are having additives to your experience You did have some perceivably powerful practitioners attempting to do work over you They were told to leave you the    alone They didnt do that They were egotistical and had to prove themselves And now they have nothing left There is a practitioner here that wont be able to work on or work for anybody else Insight I told look at did you see how it landed over here The divine has so many messages except the amplified insight that has been given to you by this individual that was attempting to work over your wheel of fortune It now belonging it now belongs to you So something about insight here You your seer abilities your oracle abilities being amplified Oo they should love you You could be having some crazy dreams right now You could be like What the    these dreams mean Youre looking into uh the energetic information thats been given to you And its crazy cuz the dream I had last night was about demonic deals that had gone bad for individuals that had set up collateral was people they loved And I was seeing this play out from like an outside view Like I was looking over the entirety of these situations going Who the    was out here making these deals Like it was it got so ugly Some of them uh it was like one of the individuals in my dreams it was their daughter and it was a couple and the other individual like their daughter was negatively affected and their souls ended up being compromised by the deal they made and their daughter was collateral and then another individual that had made this deal It was his wife and I was like who the    was making these    deals over the people they love thinking they was going to get something And the craziest part is in this dream the couple that had placed their daughter up as collateral made the deal for their daughter to have a good life And then the husband that had placed his wife up for collateral And with the deal going bad his wife in my dream ended up taking her life And he was like This shits not even worth it Like I dont even want to be here without my wife The reason that he put his wife up for collateral uh was because they were unable to have children and he wanted to have a child with her And the deal was for them to be able to not only be financially uh stable but to have a child because she wasnt supposed to And when the wife in my dream took her life she was pregnant And I was like I dont know what type of deals these people are making but theyre bad So you could be having I say all this to say you could be having dreams about whats going on with these individuals that uh were working with a practitioner where this practitioner may have bamboozled them or the deal they made backfired when this practitioner came after you Take what sleep doesnt You could even have be having dreams about whats happening to a karmic familial unit whats happening to old friends or whats happening to people that you dont even know You could have people in your dreams where youre like Who the    are these people You have taken on the sight of those that had been targeting you that at one point had been gifted until they had forfeited their gifts to you by attempting to abuse the gifts that had been given to them They have been permanently restricted while you have gained the sight of those opposing you And you may be seeing into the workings of these individuals that have had their gifts given to you And you may be confused cuz you may not know who the    these people are and whats going on Why you dreaming random individuals Its because of whats been given to you What you can now see with this amplified insight delight Yep With look enlightenment So this is about to spirits saying were delighted to elevate you in this way but please use these gifts accordingly to the divine guidance given You will see some things that dont make sense but they will help break it down for you What else do we need to know Spirit the revelation and surrender Look at this The revelation is the prophecy over your life Surrender is how many individuals have to let this go have to let you go This is or have to stop looking into your life with surrender and revelation I feel like some of you are about to with the way your gifts have been enhanced and with what youve received from who was targeting you youre going to see the fall of your enemies uh spiritually like with your gifts before you see it physically And you thought your gifts were intense Now this is like you knowing every feeling every sentence every intention of these individuals that are about to go through severe judgment or that are already experiencing severe karma They said Be aware that the gifts that you have been given they had been testing for in the gifts that youve been given that have been amplified they had been testing for in your youth seeking out special gifted children There is a reason why you were not fully activated in your younger years but why you are being fully activated and enhanced now Know that they will look for you These are individuals that have been very concerned about those in these revolutionary light leader positions Yes The gate program Exactly Exactly Sleep with light The gate program These are individuals that are either have located you like CIA energy or will soon locate you But again you should not be afraid These are individuals that seek to study to seek to understand but will not be given any type of access to the divine information that has been relayed to you All they can do is observe you So some of you need to know this is a spart a spart this is a part of your spiritual quest They said the world will see through the eyes of divinity and this is what they feared The world will see through the eyes of divinity and this is what they feared You are making massive uh imperative pivotal changes upon this planet You have already been documented as a extra what extraterrestrial theyre saying an extraterrestrial external threat to those that had been capitalizing off of the corruption But again there is nothing to fear only so much fortune to look forward to This is what 2026 holds for you and holds for the planet too Be prepared to really take on this and embody this leadership position this leadership light leader anointed powerful position What else do we need to know Cuz I know thats not for everybody I know this life is a little bit and maintain a positive outlook no matter what the matrix or what may be thrown your way in order to misalign you We got divine support The divine is working everything out in your favor So make sure not to let the little series of inconveniences that may occur this week completely aggravate and agitate you All right Remain positive and stay focused And the divine is saying I am supporting you in everything they said in every way that these blessings are coming through to you Stay open to guidance on this fast forward moving energy So spirit is saying stay open to the ways that we are going to be guiding you with whats coming in quickly and how you are meant to move forward from these individuals that are being humbled and again how you are meant to move forward steadfast with the way that your life is changing quickly Theyre saying what youre going to do with whats being given to you again Lock in Galactic Golden ohana cuz this is happening quick This is happening fast as    These blessings are happening Yeah Steadfast Look at that I told you I told you You manifested this You cocreated and cultivated this alongside the most high Anything else we need to know They said beauty Behold beauty before you What Behold beauty before you and allow the allow the dis distortion and death of the past to be laid to rest You no longer reside there You are free But Im going to leave it right there Galactic did you have a message Bring it here Bring Bring me to Saturn Bring me to Saturn No dont drop it Oh no Its not Saturn Its the asteroid Abundance Kitty has the asteroid Bro you I I keep I tell you this every time she talks Yall have not like heard Abundance Kitty be loud like that Anytime shes loud like that she has a message This time it was abundance kitty and she brought over the asteroid which means somebodys financial foundation is being completely uprooted Those that have been targeting you theyre going to remain in poverty where for you the asteroid can also symbolize the tower divine intervention There is and that was abundance kitty bringing this asteroid There is what else do you have Now she got the rocket I know you heard the little jingle in the background Now she has the rocket You better prepare for this    to be uh happening quickly This monetary means this divine intervention this windfall of wealth is happening faster than you may expect Fast as    boy I know you just heard her little skidly pips She never plays like this She really feeling something in the energy So yes blast off 2026 is going to be the year that you really take off not only within your relationships uh and your cocreations but also your monetary manifestations Whatever youre receiving is more than you think that it is Thats what I will say But I love you I appreciate you I honor you Again yeah my face is purging a little bit So yall are just going to have to bear with me uh as we are all you know acclimating to this this timeline acclimating to this energetic elevated state So again be gentle with yourselves you guys Make sure that you are you know speaking affirmations over yourself in your life Uh making sure that youre praying over your relationships over your uh environment and your babies and your fur babies and make sure that you are just remaining locked in and focused uh on what is unfolding now for you And its all that is highly favorable to your empowerment and expansion But I love you I appreciate you I miss yall so much Its so good to be back Its so good to be back I love you I appreciate you I honor you I am so proud of each and every one of you And Im so excited for everything thats coming through in 2026 knowing damn good and well that it is due to you And if I wont see you over on uh Tik Tok in about 15 minutes maybe 30 probably 15 uh then I will see you again tomorrow So until the next time I see you remain peaceful unconditionally loving stand united and remain respectful unless disrespected Then check with the Most High and check your    self before you check a    with grace And like Sha would say XXXion 88 If anybody tells you to lay down run them the    over but not with your car Vroom vroom with your energy because we have nothing to prove Our energy obviously does it for us And last but most definitely not least drink your    water It is a conduit of energy It will assist you at this time especially if you are still alchemizing or if you are acclimating to what you have alchemized in the alignment that youre currently in Remain grounded stay balanced and remember who the you are A cocreative Godanointed appointed divinely designed child of the cosmos A beautiful extremely powerful soul that came through and reincarnated in order to bring massive wave making change to this world And you have but also is set up and aligned to experience it simultaneously because as within so is your external So dont be surprised when everything in your physical reality shifts rapidly You prayed for this You wished for this And now its here You deserve every blessing that comes through But know that theres more responsibility that may be placed on you Do not move frivolously with this fortune and these finances that are being given to you I love you and until the next time I see you Blessings to you I love you "

        "plain_text": "sighs and gasps Okay all my batteries have failed Everything has failed I have a 26 remaining on that one All right so Im going to show you guys something Show you guys something If you ever have to start a generator a small generator specifically at least the one with the low oil lights or with an oil shut off Uh keep in mind I have zero W30 in my generator and I am still going to uh suffer the problem that youre about to witness Um so before I get into everything uh thank you everybody for supporting my GoFundMe I really need it Um things are not awesome So let me try to give you some useful content in return And um so the GoFundMe is to get a battery so I dont have to keep doing this Im going to show you whatll happen is your oil is going to be thick Im at such a temperature right now that I cant run this machine without a heater Youll see here So theres my generator and theres a heater stuck to it That heater is going right into the air intake You see sighs So Im having to even heat the oil as its running just to keep it running Okay So heres what were going to do Uh Ill set up the uh set the camera right over here You guys can you guys can kind of see what Im doing here So I might be able to pull it without the choke Nope So we can set the choke Pull it Going to take the choke off Okay Now see its running right now Watch what itll do Watch watch watch There you go It just shut off Thats the low oil light The wrong answer is to put more oil in it because it has the correct amount of oil in it Whats happening is your oil pump Your oil pumps not picking it up Its too solid Its Its not viscous enough So you your oil pumps going to keep shutting you down And uh you may be very frustrated wondering why wont this thing start It says theres low oil I have oil I know Shut down again Yep And what you have to do Wait till the Wait till the light shuts off There you go And so what Im doing is Im just keep on turning it on Keep on turning it on Letting that the engine eventually get warm enough to where it can warm up that oil The other answer is to take this unplug everything take it inside let the oil loosen up set it by the wood stove about 30 minutes or so or you just keep on doing this Um so Im let Im doing this to prove a point to show you it will keep shutting down Just keep restarting it and it will eventually work So you can watch me just kind of do it again and again The worst thing you could ever do in this situation is add more oil Uh whatll happen is now your now your machine will be itll work Itll instantly start sucking that other oil up start sucking through the uh you know pumping through the oil properly Jesus But then its going to be over full Uh its going to develop pressure Its going to be overpressurized Its going to push oil up uh into your cylinders and that you dont want Its going to push up into your cylinders and what doesnt burn is going to go out your exhaust and then you can you risk all sorts of issues doing that I mean you risk all sorts of issues doing that so I dont recommend Its ridiculous isnt it So this is why I need that battery Um this is one of the reasons here just to not have to constantly do this to beg my machine to work when I need it to work You know sucks Every time I want electricity this is how it has to happen Just ridiculous Oh come on So thanks to people who supported the GoFundMe right now Uh Im up tound and um Im still at 134 Still at 134 Um Jesus damn Christ dude Start I need you to start This sucks Try doing this at like 330 in the morning Woke up out of bed cold naked trying to get dressed in your    cold ass dark house to get out here and do this This sucks But like I said you know worst thing you could do is just add more oil right now Just keep on reefing The other answer like I said is to take it inside But you see how long its taking This sucks My life sucks For now itll get better Dude stop    slamming The wind is causing that door to open and close and slam This thing will get there eventually All right Are we about there You think You think its going to keep going Good I think it might It still might shut off So sighs Its just what it is dude You got to accept your lot in life Wait for the damn It be so nice and I get a battery for real Cuz I might get a battery and then Ill just charge it up and then I dont have to    do this I could you know the one battery gives me three days worth of power Three days instead of having to do this And then theres the waste of fuel Like it cost me 75 a day Like 87 to 8 a day just for electricity unsustainable I think it might actually stay going this time Yeah thats why I get that heater stuck right on that intake to heat up that oil on the oil pump So yeah I have that little heater little 500 watt stuck right on the uh stuck right on the air intake there to warm up the heat pump or oil pump you know You know what Im saying Oh snorts freaking cold Its still pretty warm in here You know what is it in here 78° Yeah cuz I just get this when Im at home Be nice if I could start working from home again cuz I Im missing out on money This is ridiculous But um yeah when Im here I can get that thing I can get the wood stove roaring 78 degrees Thats what I want I want it more like 84 sighs But yeah thats what I have to do Just fight it like that And that thats merely to um to charge the laptop Yeah And to have a light Real great use of resources right Yeah Yeah So look in the description GoFundMe I know Im harping on it but Im Im    desperate You see kind of why a little bit you know "

already for future updates That would also be greatly appreciated over here So without further ado Im going to pull the energy for you and see whats cracking and see whats coming through So lets go As always I would like to thank the angels the interdimensional beings and the spirit guides who are overseeing this the divination for the sign of Gemini Okay So the first thing that is coming through Gemini is that the selfdoubt that you are currently experiencing is not a match not a vibrational match to what needs to be said or done for the 31st of December to the 4th of January The selfdoubt that you are experiencing is not a match to what needs to be said and done You need to become more like Neo in the Matrix You need to think outside of the box right now because theres a lot of advice for you The energy that you need to embody more of is all about confidence immunity healing and integration So first things first having confidence in yourself Also you are not as vulnerable right now to certain energies that may be trying to adhere to you at this time The more you think that you are vulnerable the more that you will become vulnerable in some sort of way So youre not as vulnerable as you think to something but there needs to be some sort of putting together putting the pieces back together because um its showing me that in some way shape or form youre essentially fragmented right now within your own psyche or within your own soul Theres definitely fragments that need to be put back together put back in place but its not going to be an easy road for you to do that But the way that you do that for a lot of you is basically just finding a way to get your confidence back doing something that youre already good at or starting something new For a lot of you this is all about um the idea of a fresh new start relative to something in your life that will allow you to spiritually integrate Its been a really interesting journey for me as I ride this Saturn return journey And a lot of whats happening is that um it seems like theres like walk in soul like from a spiritual perspective Im having like all these aspects of my own consciousness that I knew I would eventually get to basically like take on a whole persona take on a whole being a whole separate being thats basically like a walkin soul Its like my own consciousness I have a different conscience about things because of where Im going and what Im doing and what I need to do compared to my old integrated state of consciousness that was good for that period of time So for you the advice thats whats happening is that if many of you have like um a lot of anxiety about life at this time for a lot of you its about the idea that you could be having a you are having a spiritual integration that allows you to experience the opposite of some sort of trauma that youve been going through Okay So and that may not look how you think it looks It may not look as exciting I definitely think thats one of the things here with this reading Gemini for you from the 31st to um the uh 4th is that its kind of like back to square one You may not know what to do because of different fragments You know the energy that you need more of the energy that you need more of to embody for your own highest good One of these cards is the oracle card of integration And integration is all about bringing two seemingly opposite things that are highly fragmented and polarized back into one single working unit or at least a cooperative unit but basically becoming whole and complete within parts of yourself that are going in two different directions And you may have a lot of these This is especially what Gemini is known for So a lot of your confidence is going to occur actually through the idea that you think your life is effed up You think youre the only one going through what youre going through Youre not Pain likes to convince you that youre the only one going through No one has it as bad as me Im the only one going through this etc We are all going through basically a collective nightmare at this moment from a certain perspective And one thing pain likes to do is to make you think that youre going through it alone But you may not be as alone as you think Especially in terms of how you navigate this This is a big choice point for you I want to emphasize this that on a practical level It seems like you have the whole world in the palm of your hands in some sort of risky new life decision going forward or you have a safe option that you can basically basically cash in on and be relatively good But theres some advice here that your safe option may be taken away from you Uh theres a quote coming into my mind about like its its like I dont want to scare any of you but its like literally its like do you have a backup And I dont believe in retirement but do you have a backup retirement plan And its cool if you do but do you have a backup retirement plan when your retirement plan doesnt work anymore Because theres some sort of risky new right of passage thats amazing thats standing in front of you Or you have the the safe bet that you have basically been cashing in on a certain plan of your life a certain way that you thought things were going to go Your challenge is that that set plan is not as set anymore at all Something that youve been building up towards planting the seeds hoping that they would sprout The honest assessment of this reading is that there is a possibility that they can still sprout But theres also a big possibility that they just completely get taken away from you something that youve been building So there needs to be a plan B for there needs to be a backup plan for every backup plan And I dont want to confuse you to make you more fragmented Maybe theres just needs to be one new risky option that you consider in your reality in some sort of way Ill explain why this is happening in a moment But lets go to your opportunity This reading came out with two cards in the opportunity two cards in the challenge So your opportunity is the justice card and the ace of wands And the justice card is also the opportunity for Aquarius So there may be a connection there The Ace of Wands is all about a fresh new start relative to inspiration healing the spirit as well Its funny that I talked about walkin souls in this reading There are certain aspects of your consciousness that are that are ready to to come on board in order to help you heal So it may feel like you have taken on a completely new persona A completely new side of you is ready to start taking control of the show The question is are you ready to let that side take control of the show or not Um this is all about bringing balance to the realm of thought relative to your own confidence in life your ability to take risks your ability to act on inspiration This is all of your opportunity because theres something that you need to do in order to remove the selfdoubt that is not currently a match to the situation But even if you remove the selfdoubt youre still stuck in a risky scenario And thats just how its going right now according to an accurate reader So in your challenge you have the six of swords and the knight of cups So I do feel that theres some sort of idealistic vision that youve had that is now becoming less and less idealistic less and less romantic less and less realistic for you And now its time to move on to a new vision to a new idealism to a new thing that you set your sights out on Now for some of you quite frankly you could just be going through a breakup within your relationships And this is the challenge when it comes to your romance There could be a shift from one partner to another or something like that or the want the desire for that It doesnt have to be like that but that could be whats going on with this The six of swords and the knight of cups could be something about you idealizing your reality that has to come to an end and you need to set a new goal and start idealizing something else But its really up to you because you have a major choice point and remember that youre not as vulnerable as you think you are at this time You do have a lot of um opportunities to regain your confidence at this time but the safer option is super risky for you at this time And so is the new option There is no safe option for you at this time But guess what You did not come here to arrive at death safely in this reality All that you do when you play it safe is you get to your bed with uh your your deathbed with regrets um sometimes But let me show you the so so romantic issues not knowing whether you should move on from a romantic situation or not because a lot of you have a cold partner that youre not connecting with emotionally For the mas for the Gemini um men out there there can be a real cold    in your life that just makes you feel emotionally horrible They might they just make you feel emotionally horrible They make you feel horrible They make your heart closed basically For the Gemini women out there theres probably a man in your life that is very cold as well that gives you a lot of emotional problems So for a lot of you you are stuck in the situation I will say this song should I stay or should I go And that of course is a featured song in Stranger Things which I have been on the real life set of gaslight set non gaslight set you know its all there Um lets go to your overall general energy And this is the choice point that I was pointing out to you You have the two of wands which is a choice point a safer option behind you including that seven of pentacles You have the four of wands ahead of you a right of passage which requires enthusiasm a risk of danger but you are in the right frequency So youre not in a bad space You do have options at this time Um you do have options at this time but you need to follow the one that will increase your confidence basically at this time and and induce a state of healing and integrating yourself in some sort of way cuz you may have a really split personality that someone in your life is basically just like causing you to become to have to become more split And I dont think its your fault I feel like theres a theres a situation in your life or you have two different sides to yourself You keep getting pushed into one side of yourself because youre like you need to do that in this reality or something like that Um so be aware of that in your uh what you dont see coming You have the king of swords the lovers card and the five of cups So yeah a lot of coldness not being on the same page on an emotional level For some of you this is definitely going to have to do with a soulmate experience Lovers you know reality feels harsh reality feels bleak I want to go out on a limb and say that a lot of you are for some of you youre not with the right person and you already know that but you have to be with them for some sort of reason right now For a lot of you and I dont want to make this sound like a romantic novel because you dont need a soulmate to be whole and complete You dont need it but a lot of your life force energy is somehow being drained by like not being with someone that youre meant to be with And for some of you you feel like youre caught in a loselose situation relative to this choice that you need to make on a romantic level or just regaining your confidence to go out on a quest because some of you you need to re completely um you need to completely revamp your requ your your quest in life Start a new quest in life with this justice card and the ace of wands Do something bold Fortune favors the bold But in your advice you have the five of pentacles the nine of cups and the seven of swords So heres the cautionary tale part of this reading There may be something that you need to do to outsmart someone For a lot of you youre being schemed Youre being tricked into a situation that you didnt even realize you were being schemed or tricked into A lot of this is saying Watch out out For some of you you need to like realize that something that youve been investing in that you thought was going to go good that you thought could you could work through that you could overcome now is drying up but you still have a chance to make it work with that but it seems like its drying up And then you have this seven of swords with your nine of pentac your nine of um nine of cups So this does talk about the idea of trickery relative to synchronicity The idea of being on the lookout for negative synchronicity Sometimes following signs and synchronicities lead you straight to the thing that you want that will increase your expansion Sometimes it will lead you straight to hell Because the idea is that if you are always at the effect of what you are receiving and following the signs like a blind or like a dog then it may lead you to something that will lead to your expansion But if you can kind of cultivate this is what I want I know what I want I know who I want I know what I want etc It will just streamline you there And Im not saying its your fault for that because right now theres a big as we know theres a big AI arms race going on and that filters down into citizen life So unfortunately theres a lot of signs and synchronicities that are being put in your path by people or groups of being or by AI beings or whatever that do not have your best interest in hand to basically make you think you are doing the right thing by following the signs and synchronicities when may or may youre leading straight to the path of hell So this is about the advice is that is that theres people trying to scheme your synchronicities Theres theres beings theres people trying to scheme your synchronicities trying to put something there trying to gaslight you in some sort of way For others of you its letting you know that you need to come up with a new plan before your old plan gets completely dried up in some sort of way Thats really what I feel about this reading So now lets go ahead and get into um some more of it Lets go ahead and clarify why this two of wands this choice point you do have the tower and the uh wheel of fortune coming in Why is the two of wands here for you in your overall general energy Knight of wands This is definitely about the contemplation of a new adventure with that justice card and the ace of wands A new beginning A lot of fiery energy relative to this choice point Having confidence in yourself but there could be travel involved with this There could be a new journey that you have to give you an old journey youre giving up a new journey youre youre going on Why is the two of wo of wands here for you Theres something about this investment or something leading to betrayal or something like that The seven of pentacles is clarified by the page of wands the devil the seven of cups and the nine of swords So it seems like this is your new point Like when I shuffled this they jumped right on the direction This ace this knight of wands jumped right into the future right into the more risky option that leads you to the four of wands and having to navigate a scheming synchronicity timeline It does seem like some like the danger of this is this Whatever your backup plan is or whatever set plan you have is or something like that Gemini Um it seems to be leading you to a nightmarish situation with this devil card nine of swords and the and the seven of cups It seems to be leading to emotional heartbreak confusion a and things like that and a lot of immaturity or something like that For some of you this is about the idea of like completing something or going back in time But at the same time this is about something that youve been investing in The safer option is no longer going to work because of some sort of reason So you have a risky option in front of you but thats honestly whats looking like the really only option for you So you have a choice for a lot of you You also have a choice to be with someone whos a little bit emotionally cold versus uh emotional wreck Um but dont judge a book by its cover Lets go ahead now and uh keep going Lets clarify that justice and ace of wands in your opportunity here Yeah you have that five of cups popping right out on that five of pentacles You also have the five of cups and what you dont see coming So this is now a duplicate So there is some sort of justice ace of wands with the star card and the five of cups So this is all about healing integrating your sadness integrating your sadness here Gemini in some sort of way A new beginning that helps you move on from the past because a lot of times this is a change to your emotions The number five has to do with change traveling The cups have to do with emotions Theres something that youre youre trying to drink these cups They already theyre done And theres a fresh spring of water right here thats just flowing constantly and its going to lead to you to a new beginning But a lot of you are like like and I dont mean to be fish I dont mean to be fish I I dont mean to be rude but some of you are trying to pick up cups that are completely empty and drink from them So you need to become confident enough so that you dont end up in that situation I dont I just dont understand you Judgement on a scheme there Theres definitely judgement on a seven of swords energy going on right now for you Also this is about your social mask falling off You see it all just hit me This is your life with your safer option This is your social mask that you put on and act like everything is just fine Everythings fine Everythings good Everythings good And then this is the advice is to exit this cycle of social mask which doesnt lead to confidence or healing I just call judgment on your seven of swords A lot of you yes this is seven of swords judgment on a scheme particularly a synchronistic scheme more So this is about its judgment day to stop wearing a mask and to just freaking six of swords knight of cups this situation At least this is in your challenge Why its in your challenge Well page of swords Youve been thinking about it Youve been thinking about it Lets go ahead and clarify this six of swords Actually you know what Lets leave that alone I think we said enough about that Um lets clarify that nine of cups that social mask or that negative synchronicity or that thing that you need to jump on the wave of Yes you need to defend your future right now from something really bad here Seven of swords immediately blocking out this five of pentacles and you kind of getting away with all the goods We have a lot of really positive cards coming out right here So I think its judgment day that there needs to be a boundary put up to whatever this five of pentacles frequency is Whenever I show it to you what is this frequency when you when I put it up What is this to you Thats the energy that you need to put up a boundary with in your reality Any closing remarks Yeah its time to admit to the pain that youre actually in and channel that potential aggression in order to make those changes into your life Channel your confidence in order to make that change in your life So with that being said Im going to conclude this reading Thank you so much Peace "

        "plain_text": "Theres like this deafening silence right now If this message found you or if you clicked on this message because the title of it called you in then this message is 100 for you And this is a message for people who are not in divine partnership yet Okay Like this is a pretty obvious message Youre not in a relationship right now or yet right And this is one of those messages where the angels are coming through really strongly and theyre telling me theyre saying use your willpower for this message and if you make it to the end of this message itll make sense But were going to start in a place that might not make any sense to you So what Im hearing is that the angels are scheming The angels are scheming Okay this is about love But the angels are saying that they pulled you into this message specifically using the title of this message because its actually the complete opposite So stay with me Like I said patience good things come to those who wait Okay Im feeling a sense of anger at love Im feeling a sense of anger at yourself And Im feeling a sense of I almost want to say like theres just this part of you thats like rising thats like a a little bit angry at the universe but like not at the same time Okay And this energy is um swirling around inside of you and creating this deafening silence I feel like there is a part of you that feels kind of disgusted by the thought of love right now And when I say disgusted its because love hasnt stopped teaching you lessons Love hasnt softened Its not that love hasnt softened I feel like love has softened if you really look at your history of love But Im getting love hasnt softened in the way that you feel like you know that its supposed to soften Okay And I feel like this is a funny message because its almost like the angels called you here to be like Were going to tell you some truths right now Were going to give you some truth bombs So as I was driving this morning I was like Okay Im just going to open my channel to the angels and Im going to see what they want to say and Im going to give them space and Im going to give them time because I didnt even know if I was going to channel today Ive woken up super late Everything has gone so much slower than I expected it to And I feel like thats very um reflective of your journey in love I feel like theres going to be a bit of a throat block coming through here in this message So if Im coughing or if Im like um slowing down to take drinks and I drink or breathe its because there is a lot coming up and clearing in this message Okay And again so I was driving this morning and I was like Im going to get a coffee today coffee could be significant for someone Its like Im gonna get a coffee And as I was going to get my coffee I heard the angels say Nows not the time They didnt say exactly that Theres like a white bird on the fence right now This could be significant for someone Hi buddy Are you trying to say hi to people He literally like peeked his neck out and he was like Um okay Love has been slower for you than I feel like it has been for other people And I think it pisses you off to be completely honest I think it like it doesnt really because I feel like youve been softening into that but theres also this part of you I feel like theres this really divine sense of anger inside of you or rage like a divine rage that has been coming up inside of you recently and its funny because its tied to love and its also tied to your love for yourself So what I heard from the angels is that this message called you in because theres a part of you thats like Oh is love coming Like ew like I dont want love but like Oh I do want love You know like theres this part of you thats like youre opening yourself for it And at the exact same time youre angry at it but its because youre angry at yourself in the terms of love Okay Its not like youre like looking at yourself and youre like Im not Im not happy with you Okay Its not that kind of an energy I told you mucus I dont know Theres going to be clearing in this message Im like I can I can feel that But the angels called you into this message to basically say its not time yet But they called you in by making you think its time So thats what I mean by theyre being a little sneaky Theyre being a little sneaky with you because theyre basically trying to sit you down and say right now the only person that youre supposed to be in love with is yourself Right now the only person that youre supposed to be showing up for is yourself right now the only person that youre supposed to be diving into and giving your energy to is yourself And I think that thats um I think you know this which is why this is like hard And I also think that recently the journey of love for you has been slower than expected has had weird twists or turns and has really brought up this anger inside of you or this part of you thats like feeling that divine rage And its brought it up because theres a part of yourself which has been abandoning yourself in order to make love happen Okay When love is meant to happen for you youre not supposed to make it happen And this is a super uncomfortable energy And Im moving the camera a bunch because you know me thats just what happens I move the camera when Im really uncomfortable Um but Im also getting this energy of nothing is as it seems So its funny because all this all this divine rage thats coming up in you right now in terms of love is coming up for a reason And its coming up because youre finally ready to face the ways that youve abandoned yourself in the pursuit of love Okay Because this is very significant because all of your energy and essence is meant to be redirected back onto you and its a hard decision to make It is hard to choose yourself And the way that your divine partner comes in is through the choosing of yourself And whats funny is that Im getting this vibe of like you kind of have this part of you thats also angry at everything thats being said right now because youre like I have been choosing myself Like I have been showing up for myself more than Ive ever shown up for myself Ooh confirmation in my entire life Like I have showed up for myself What are you talking about Like Ive worked so hard to show up for myself and Im getting that energy Okay And thats that divine rage right Let that come up first Youre allowed to be angry Youre also allowed to witness where the anger stems from Okay which is that selfabandonment And thats hard Okay this isnt an easy energy But what I am getting is that youre supposed to be in this journey right now which youre already in but youre in this journey where youre learning to choose yourself over Im almost getting like over the pursuit of love in ways that you know love isnt fully meant to arrive for you Okay so kind of vague but kind of specific Its almost as if youve been choosing yourself and then you get to this point where youve been choosing yourself and then an opportunity comes in to love And in the pursuit of love you choose love and you choose that experience of loving But I almost get this vibe that youre someone who just like loves like I feel like and this is Im getting such a hard energy like such a throat block because I feel like when you love you give away love instead of loving through loving yourself and choosing yourself And I think thats the lesson that youre learning right now And its not really that youre like being taught this hard lesson Its more so that youre learning to love yourself to love others and to give to yourself to give to others and to choose yourself to choose others and for others to choose you And its in this journey that it its so its so important for you to be learning to choose yourself right now Even though it feels hard even though youre angry even though youre pissed off at love or blaming whatever concept you want to blame right whatever comes up inside of you even though youre wanting to do that its this this is so important for you to be feeling these things And thats what Im feeling from your angels right now is that this is such an important time for you to be in this energy and to let all of this come up because something that is happening in this journey specifically for you is this really beautiful unmasking of the ways that youve abandoned yourself and this really beautiful witnessing of the versions of yourself that havent shown up for you so that you can be more of you And I feel like its so important because your divine lover is going to love all of you And they are not meant to show up until you love all of you And in order to love all of you you have to unmask all the versions of you All the versions of you that are angry all the versions of you that are sad all of the versions of you that have abandoned yourself And you have to merge with them And this is that process that is happening right now And its happening through your pursuit of love and learning how to be in the pursuit of loving thyself in order to love others And I feel like this is so important so significant for you because theres just something so profound about the connection that youre truly meant to be in And I just get this vibe that you have a deeper purpose in love like you have its almost like I feel like you really came here with a like part of your sole purpose being on earth is to love Okay its not as simple as like yeah love is cool but its like its part of your written prophecy to love and to love in a way that teaches others how to love fully And in order to do that I just feel like this is so powerful for you because in order to do that you have to go through the heroine journey or the heros journey Sorry Ive never done female before male before Thats funny Thats cute Um but you have to go through that journey in order to be that person that teaches Okay So I like your angels are basically saying that you have to experience it first if youre bound to teach it by being okay And so thats why it feels um s like such a challenge Like love for you feels like a challenge And love for you feels like a challenge that keeps getting steeper Its like youre you thought you were climbing a mountain and then you thought you were climbing a snowy mountain and then you got to the deeper parts of the snow and it got colder and suddenly suddenly the oxygen became minimal and you were like I thought this was hard before but like now I cant breathe and then you realize oh Im climbing Mount Everest Youre like My my challenge is Mount Everest What the    bro And youre like reserving oxygen at the same time And youre like I dont know why this is so good but Im just Its funny because its not funny And theres so much anger in this and like irritation in this journey that youre on that its actually funny Like I feel like there are moments in your journey of the pursuit of love where you have genuinely looked at everything or had things happen in your journey of love and youve been like this is    You know like I just get this vibe that you think its funny but its like not at the same time Like I feel like youve been like real irritated and like mad at love and like whatever right like however it has come up for you Im getting this vibe of like its just been like not cool But then I think that theres these really random moments that you have where you sit back and you laugh and you go This is a    joke bro Like okay I see I see how my angels are probably laughing on the other side at me trying to do this love thing because what the    bro Like I just get this this vibe from you And I do think that you have this really great humor to you I feel like that is so significant But heres the thing Okay now we can start talking about like the love part because if youve made it this far again like I said that in the beginning of this message and the angels told me to go so slow with this energy cuz they were like its only the people that have the willpower to stick around that are really meant to receive this message And they told me that on the drive They they showed me how to start this channelneled message and how to go slow with it and breathe with it Okay Because thats also in representation of your patience Like your patience is about to be rewarded but youre still climbing Mount Everest Like Im getting this energy that like you are about to be rewarded in significant ways in love in a partner a divine partner that you know is meant for you that youve had dreams about that you have literally always felt for you Theyre going to blow your    mind Like theyre going to show you that there are worlds that you have never really truly like understood exist when they arrive Its happening for you okay And its I am getting that its sooner than you think it is but its also set up in your reality to arrive in a way that you will never know when its going to happen And thats like thats really hard too cuz I can feel for you This is so good that your lover is set up to be hidden from you until the day they are meant to arrive So youre not going to    know bro Like youre youre not going to see it coming And thats the best part about this entire thing I literally feel like youre h Whats that one song The white bird is back over there Its called Love in the Dark I cant play it for you but thats kind of what Im feeling Like I feel like youre like learning to love in the unknown like in the dark and youre not supposed to see whats coming next for you But theres this really really significant journey that youre on right in this exact moment when this message has found you Right And Im also getting an ache in the back of my masculine side Like I almost feel like I feel like love has pronounced you to be the leader in a partnership that was always meant to be masculine and feminine And Im almost getting that like you have had to take on the role of the opposing end And I I feel like a majority of this collective is feminine Im going to be honest with you Um but there are some masculines here So Im going to keep it um open to all energies but Im just feeling that like for the majority or for everyone in this collective literally you have had to take on the opposing end of the energy of your divine partner because you were almost like what theyre telling me is that you This is so cool Theyre saying that you have lived both ends of a divine partnership through yourself And thats whats still happening right now where youve taken on the role of both your divine partner and yourself in this connection So that when this person does arrive also youre going to have a level of compassion respect and gratitude for them in your reality because you understand how much effort and love they put in because youve done it for yourself and done it in the ways that theyre going to show up Like I just feel like theres a part of you that like almost doesnt even believe in love anymore Its not that you dont believe in love okay thats kind of harsh but I I feel like theres this part of you thats just like kind of fed up with love and youre just like Im kind of like sick of wanting it you know Like theres a part of you thats just like annoyed at the fact that you still want love But deep down you know that youre meant to experience love And so this is just so significant because when it does come in for you it is going to literally like youre going to have so much gratitude for it because of how much you have experienced both ends of it And also the parts of it that like you in your divine like union are meant to be more melty in one end of it youve done both ends for so long that youre going to youre never ever going to forget And I feel like thats really important too because theres a part of you that like when you enter into love you may have like a fear that like Yeah I feel this coming through Hold on I feel like theres a part of you that has a fear that when love does finally come in and you really want it and you really know its your person I feel like theres youre someone whos going to know who your person is when you meet them Oo thats a confirmation too Like youre going to know in your bones that thats your person And yet I feel like theres a part of you thats going to worry that youre going to fall out of love like and I I think thats one of your fears actually Like it really feels like its coming up as like a fear in love is that theres a part of you that worries that you wont continue to fall more and more in love because theres a part of you that I feel like youve experienced this in past relationships or uh connections where youve been able to love fall in love fall so deeply in love and then and then fall out of love I feel like thats been a repetitive pattern and you I dont think you have ever found someone that youve fallen more in love with over time like again and again and again and I think that thats because you havent met your divine person yet and thats also hard because its almost like your your your reality has taught you that or made you think I dont want to say like really taught you because theres a part of you that knows deeper but your reality has made you think that or has created this fear inside of you that you dont know if there is someone out there that will rise to the occasion of you and continue to be someone that you want to rem meet over and over and over and refell in love with over and over and over and over Like it almost feel like theres a part of you that almost like again like you feel fed up with love and you almost like dont believe it anymore Even though theres a part of you because this is such a part of your purpose in this world Theres a part of you that knows better and knows stronger and knows more divinely that that its there And so when you get mad at it its almost like this reflective Hold on Its its almost like this reflective energy that happens for you where you get angry at love but then you get angry at yourself because you know that love is there And so instead youre just like getting mad in this circle and then it gets like I feel like theres this big part of love and the anger that you feel with love that gets like turned on to yourself and I think that thats something that youre also growing through cuz how long is this message going to be because this is a much deeper longer message than I expected it to be Um what Im feeling for you is that right now cuz lets talk about right this moment right Because I feel like right now in this moment youre like Ew what the fuck And I feel like theres this energy that you have where youre just kind of like fade or faded Theres this part of you thats just like irritated with love where youre just like Im done Like I almost get this like fed up energy Thats what I was trying to say Fed up Its a fed up energy at love And its actually again we already talked about this Its a fed up energy at the version of you that has abandoned yourself every single time love has been an option and youve abandoned yourself in order to try and attain that love even though you knew deeper down that that wasnt it for you that there was something deeper out there and I think that thats something thats also really hard for you because I think you understand that there are certain lessons that you asked for in love to of course bring you to this part of yourself like again this like this present storyline that youre living is about you falling in love with yourself Its about you choosing yourself And thats why youre getting these opportunities also to love where its almost like youre getting these amazing opportunities that look like shiny gold stars right And youre like Oh my god I want the gold star I want the gold star And its almost like the gold star is twodimensional Its a sticker but you thought it was a 3D opportunity at love You know what I mean Like you thought it was like a 5D opportunity You were like Oh my god But then you give all of yourself over to reaching for this star and when you reach it you peel it off and youre like Its a sticker Its a 2D sticker Youre like Okay Im mad Im mad Why did I just completely unoute myself in order to reach this 2D sticker And so I feel like youve had a lot of these experiences in love where youve done this over and over and over again And youve done this because youre youre getting these experiences to basically reroute you on the path of choosing yourself Okay my battery Im going to change it really quick Anyways youre on these experiences is youre getting all these experiences so that you can be rerouted back again and again and again to choosing yourself And I feel like this message is arriving for you at a really its an irritable time but its an awesome time because this message is arriving when youre finally feeling like youre not going to take the gold star Like theres a part of you thats like I dont want another 2D star I want to stay on my path of choosing myself and a star will appear on my path Im seeing Mario Kart right now like a star when theyre driving and theyre like its just right there available for you Thats what I feel is coming for you Okay And I I do just keep getting this message and this vibe that like right now I know that like everyone wants to hear like your soulmates coming and theyre right around the corner and theyre going to show up for you and theyre going to be here for you And this is not that message Its not that thats not true but this message is your soulmate will you will not know theyre coming till the day that they show up And thats the honest truth of it And the honest truth of it is that theyre not going to show up unless you choose yourself So this message is pretty much also your angels cheering you on and giving you guidance to say choose you Like if you want to feel chosen if you want a partner thats going to choose you choose you first and stick the stick to the guns You know what I mean Like do not veer off your own path and let a gold star concept pull you away from your divine destiny because this is such a big lesson for you and its almost like your partner I feel is also on this journey where like they keep getting disappointed by love too and its because you guys are meant for each other Like I know that I know that theres all that energy thats like are there really soulmates and are people really meant for us and like dont you just choose them and all the reasons that you could say in your head is to get mad at at love again right But what Im feeling is that there really is something so divine about you specifically and your your purpose in love I feel like this is a message for a collective of beings that are genuinely meant to teach in love and teach in love by being in love and by finding love in a very specific way And I feel like thats a lesson or like a something that youre meant to continue to teach throughout the rest of your life And your story is going to be so powerful in that journey like your story and the way that you talk about love especially in the years to come I feel like especially because theres that throat block that we had come through too Anytime that theres a throat block I think it has to do with the fact that your voice is so powerful and youre meant to speak Okay And I feel like youre meant to speak upon love Youre going to be telling stories throughout your life maybe even some of you for mass collectives about the ways that you found love And its really important that the story that youre telling is about how you chose yourself first And I feel like thats part of your divine destiny of love because you came here also at this time on earth in order to bring love to a new a new Im hearing dimension like to basically like create a new level of love that exists on this planet and that has to happen through loving thyself and youre one of the Im getting like you could be a thought leader but Im getting like a thought leader in terms of love in this world Um so its almost like youre one of the first wave of people thats here to tell a story about love that has been unwritten or written over is what Im getting So its almost like your story of love is going to be a story that writes or rewrites a concept that has been long forgotten about love that has been removed from history books about love that has been written over or unwritten Im getting confirmation of this too So I feel like I also like get the vibe that like this comes from a soul that has a dimensional history is what Im hearing So I feel like you could be a very old soul but Im getting that your soul may have lived in many places other than just Earth Okay feel like your soul is dimensionally historic and thats why you have the memory in you already to tell a story and experience a story of love in this way and its to bring it back I also feel like there is a lot of that happening on earth at this time where theres a lot of historic souls that have knowledge deeper inside them in their aosic history that has been forgotten unwritten or written over by humanity And I feel like a lot of these teachings and this knowledge that has always existed but has been forgotten is being brought back through souls like yours which are meant to retell the story and make new history Like I Ooh I just got full body chills for that Its like in the concept of Earth youre going to be making history with these stories that youre living to tell but theyre actually such a historic natural phenomenon that has existed before but has been unwritten by um Earth Earth society That is so    cool bro I have like also sworn a lot in this message Im so sorry Pardon my French Um this was a cool message I hold strong my friend I actually really feel like this is going to be like got a message the other day that was like the new you or this version of you is about to shatter the paradigm And I really feel like that is so true for this part of this journey this part of your story as well because I feel like this is that moment where you stop taking turns off of your own path to grab stars that look 3D but end up being twodimensional or look 5D and end up being twodimensional right Like this is thats going to be such a this is such a big time for you because youre choosing you And thats so incredibly powerful I dont think you even realize how powerful that is because you may even have confirmation of this in your physical world where like certain moves that youre making right now like some people are looking at you and being like Oh thats like actually really    cool that youre doing that Like thats actually like really inspirational Like and you might have confirmation of that through people in your life where youre like Oh like this is huge Like this is a big deal that like and Im not doing this for anyone and Im doing this for me And also I feel like theres another little message here about this anger that youve been feeling this divine anger And I feel like again its an opportunity I dont know why this is coming through again but its an opportunity for you to look at yourself and hold yourself in all the ways that you have abandoned yourself Okay because you have literally gone off path and that was a version of you that abandoned your rightful um abundance Its a version of you that has youve always known that you have this beautiful divine path but youve literally run off course And that anger that youre feeling is for the version of you that let something false or some kind of an illusion lead you astray Youre feeling anger for that But in reality its just like running through a maze Okay Im seeing like a video game of a maze You dont get mad at PacMan when PacMan goes up and goes left and goes down and then accidentally runs into a corner that has nowhere else to go but you have to turn back around You dont get mad at PacMan You just go Oh shit And then you just twist and you go back the other way until you can go eat the other things And so thats kind of like how your angels are guiding you to be like instead of looking like that abandonment Um youre looking at it with like a view of that was wrong in reality it was just you exploring and thats okay It may may feel like you could have gotten things sooner like love It may feel like oh if I didnt do that maybe I would have hit love sooner But in reality you probably wouldnt have like you even if you didnt take that turn you would have gone up ahead and you probably would have still needed the experience that you had in order to know that that was a wrong turn And I feel like theres a part of you that just um is almost being like guided right now Bang bang bang I dont know if you guys could hear that but someone was banging on something Um theres a part of you thats being guided right now too Uh remember that every turn that you have made has been an opportunity for soul growth And thats beautiful And that rage yes you can feel it but also dont direct it towards yourself Remember that you learned a turn was a dead end And thats knowledge Thats education Thats power for you because now you know not to do that again right And even if you do accidentally do it again thats okay I feel like you wont but if you do its okay Youll be like Oh    like PacMan Its just its fun and youll youll get there And I know that love has felt slow for you I know that it feels like sometimes love is never actually going to be real for you that its never actually going to arrive But through this message and the energies that I have felt um its not possible for it not to arrive Like you have too much of a divine connection to love for it not to arrive in your lifetime this lifetime And it is going to But remember just take all of your energy right now to hold yourself love yourself witness the versions of you that you feel have abandoned you and thank them for being a part of you and for teaching you a lesson and move on and say Im going up and right and left now Okay And your lover is going to surprise the    out of you when they just come out of absolutely nowhere And its going to be epic Its going to be epic dude Okay I love you so much And if this message resonated with you or found you I would literally love to know Send me a cute little message on Instagram um about about love and Ill know that you came from this message Uh but I love you guys and I will see you in the next message "

        "plain_text": "They grow up misunderstood too quiet too intense too slow At least thats what the world tells them While others chase applause they observe While others rush into careers relationships identities they hesitate not from fear but from depth Carl Jung believed that the rarest personality is not built for early success It is built for late emergence These individuals often feel out of sync with time itself As children they sense more than they can explain As young adults they struggle to fit into systems designed for speed noise and imitation Society rewards the loud the aggressive the adaptable But Jung warned What adapts too easily often lacks a true self The rare personality carries an inner weight a long incubation period Their life does not unfold in straight lines It spirals inward before it expands outward They fail early They wander They appear lost But beneath that delay something is forming A self that is not borrowed A mind that is not programmed A purpose that cannot be rushed And when they finally rise it is not dramatic It is inevitable This video is not about motivation It is about understanding why the rarest personality often succeeds after everyone else and why that delay is not a weakness but the very source of their power If youve always felt late to life this may explain everything There is a type of person Carl Jung spoke about indirectly carefully almost reluctantly Not because it was insignificant but because it was rare This personality does not dominate classrooms It does not shine in early careers It does not move fast compete loudly or seek validation Instead it watches Jung understood something most modern psychology ignores Human development is not uniform Some personalities are designed for early adaptation Others are designed for late individuation And the rarest personality belongs to the second group From the very beginning of life this individual feels different Not superior not inferior just misaligned As a child they often appear inward serious or strangely mature They ask questions that dont fit their age They feel emotions they dont yet have language for But here is the paradox While they may seem old inside they are developmentally delayed outwardly They struggle in systems that reward speed obedience and imitation School punishes them Society misunderstands them Peers outgrow them Or so it appears Jung believed this early friction was not accidental It was psychological necessity One the inner world is too strong Most people build their identity by absorbing the external world They copy values goals behaviors This creates early confidence but often shallow foundations The rare personality is different Their inner world is unusually vivid thoughts symbols emotions intuitions all collide at once Jung would describe this as a psyche where the unconscious is highly active This creates a problem early in life because when the inner world is louder than the outer one adaptation becomes difficult They cannot simply become what society asks them to be Not because they are rebellious but because their psyche resists false alignment So they hesitate They delay choices others make easily Career paths relationships beliefs identities From the outside this looks like confusion From the inside it feels like suffocation Jung warned that forcing such individuals into premature identities can cause lifelong neurosis The psyche fractures when it lives a life that does not belong to it So the rare personality unconsciously resists early success two why they fall behind and why its necessary In their 20s the contrast becomes painful Others are advancing promotions marriages social status confidence The rare personality feels stuck They may jump from path to path They may retreat into isolation They may appear unambitious or lost But Yung would say this is not stagnation This is incubation Their psyche is doing something invisible While others are building social structures the rare personality is building psychological structure They are unconsciously asking questions most people postpone until midlife Who am I really What is authentic What part of me is shadow What is borrowed What is true These questions slow you down but they save you later Jung observed that many people who succeed early collapse inwardly later Midlife crisis depression emptiness These are symptoms of a life lived without individuation The rare personality pays the price early so they dont pay it later Three the burden of consciousness One of Yungs most unsettling ideas was this Greater consciousness equals greater suffering The rare personality is often painfully aware of hypocrisy of manipulation of social games of power dynamics of meaninglessness They see through illusions others rely on to function This makes early participation difficult How do you compete in a game you dont believe in How do you chase status you dont respect How do you imitate a life that feels empty So they withdraw not always physically but psychologically This withdrawal is often mistaken for weakness In reality it is selfp protection Jung believed the psyche will sabotage external success if it threatens inner integrity Thats why the rare personality often fails when success comes too early The soul refuses to cooperate Four loneliness as a developmental stage Loneliness is not an accident for this personality type It is almost inevitable because their inner complexity makes shallow connection unsatisfying and deep connection rare They may feel alien even among friends invisible in groups unreachable in intimacy This loneliness often peaks in the late 20s or early 30s And this is dangerous Many rare personalities break here They numb themselves They conform They abandon the self forming inside them Jung warned that betraying the emerging self creates a lifelong shadow Resentment bitterness selfhatred Those who endure the loneliness without surrendering undergo something crucial ego dissolution They stop defining themselves by external validation They stop chasing timelines that arent theirs They begin listening inwardly This is when the true transformation begins but it is still invisible Five The shadow becomes a teacher because they fail early The rare personality becomes intimate with their shadow Doubt envy anger fear inferiority Most people repress these traits The rare personality studies them They analyze their darkness They question their motives They wrestle with contradictions This internal confrontation is exhausting but it creates depth Jung believed that only those who integrate their shadow can wield real power later in life Power without shadow integration becomes tyranny addiction or collapse This is why the rare personality matures slowly but solidly They dont build on denial They build on truth Six Why society mislabels them Society has no category for people who bloom late So it uses insults lazy unmotivated overthinking wasted potential But Yung would argue the opposite These individuals are not lacking direction They are resisting premature crystallization They sense often without words that choosing too early means choosing falsely So they wait And waiting looks like failure until it doesnt Seven The first signs of emergence toward the mid30s or early 40s something shifts not externally at first internally Clarity replaces anxiety Selfrust replaces comparison Depth replaces urgency They stop asking who they should be They start embodying who they are And because the self is not borrowed it is powerful Their voice becomes calm Their decisions become precise Their presence becomes unmistakable Jung believed this is when the rare personality finally enters life Not as a participant but as a force But this emergence only happens because of everything that came before The delays the failures the isolation the suffering None of it was wasted It was preparation Most people live by imitation long before they ever discover themselves They inherit ambitions values and timelines without question It works at first Society rewards adaptation It rewards speed It rewards obedience disguised as ambition The rare personality cannot do this for long By the time they reach their 30s something fundamental has already changed inside them While others are exhausting themselves maintaining identities they chose too early the rare personality begins to feel a strange inner stabilization Not confidence in the traditional sense but alignment This is where Yungs idea of individuation becomes decisive Individuation is not selfimprovement It is selfreovery It is the slow removal of everything false Because the rare personality delayed external commitment they avoided one of the greatest psychological traps Building a life on an unexamined ego their earlier confusion now becomes an advantage They are no longer searching outwardly They are consolidating inwardly And consolidation creates gravity People begin to feel them before they understand them Their words carry weight not because they speak often but because when they do nothing is wasted They are not trying to impress They are not trying to dominate They are simply expressing what has already been tested internally for years Jung believed authority that is not integrated collapses under pressure Authority that emerges from individuation does not need reinforcement That is why the rare personality often rises quietly No cement no sin ambition no hunger for approval Opportunities start appearing but they are different from earlier temptations They are aligned with competence rather than ego responsibility rather than status meaning rather than image This is why these individuals often succeed in fields requiring longterm thinking leadership strategy psychology philosophy art systems building They see patterns others miss because they have spent years observing rather than competing While others learned how to win they learned how things actually work Another transformation happens here Something subtle but decisive They stop fearing judgment Not because they become arrogant but because judgment loses relevance When your identity is no longer dependent on external approval criticism cannot destabilize you Praise cannot intoxicate you You become psychologically unbribable Jung considered this state rare and dangerous to rigid systems because such individuals cannot be controlled by rewards or fear This is also why they often attract projection Others sense their autonomy and respond unconsciously Some with admiration others with hostility The rare personality becomes a mirror People project their own unexamined selves onto them This is where social dynamics reverse Earlier in life they were overlooked Now they are watched Earlier they doubted themselves Now others doubt themselves around them This shift can feel disorienting at first Many rare personalities hesitate to step into visibility because they still carry the memory of early rejection But Yung warned Refusing ones rightful place is also a betrayal of the self Individuation does not mean hiding It means bearing the weight of who you have become This is where their shadow integration becomes critical because they know their darkness They are not afraid of power They do not need to abuse it They do not need to prove anything Their ambition is surgical Their movements are economical Their energy is conserved This is late life momentum While others burn out they are just beginning Relationships change too The rare personality no longer seeks intensity for validation They seek resonance fewer connections but deeper cleaner more stable They stop trying to be understood by everyone and start being understood by the right ones Jung believed this was a sign of psychological maturity the capacity to endure being misunderstood without becoming bitter And bitterness is the final test Many who almost make it fail here They look back at lost years with resentment They measure themselves against false timelines and poison their own emergence Those who succeed do something different They reinterpret the past They no longer see delay as failure They see it as insulation protection preparation And this reframing unlocks energy They stop dragging the past behind them They integrate it They use it Their story becomes coherent not impressive not dramatic but internally consistent This is when their influence expands Not through force but through example Others sense stability in a world of fragmentation They become reference points anchors Jung believed such individuals often become guides without intending to mentors without advertising leaders without titles Their presence reorganizes space And yet they remain free They are not addicted to outcomes They are not chasing legacy They are not afraid of endings because they already survived the hardest thing becoming themselves without permission And this is why their success when it comes does not consume them It expresses them By the time the rare personality reaches the second half of life the game most people are still trapped in has already lost its grip on them Status no longer seduces them Approval no longer directs them Fear no longer rushes them This is where Yungs psychology becomes almost prophetic He believed the second half of life is not meant for expansion outward but for expansion upward meaning wisdom integration Most people never reach this stage because they spend their energy defending identities built too early The rare personality arrives here prepared While others panic at aging clinging to youth relevance and recognition the rare personality experiences something unexpected Relief They are finally aligned with time Their energy increases because it is no longer divided They are not pretending not proving not performing Their psyche is unified And a unified psyche is powerful This is why their peak often comes after 40 Not louder not flashier but undeniable They move slowly now not because they are unsure but because speed is no longer necessary Every decision is filtered through depth Every commitment is deliberate Waste disappears Jung believed the stage creates a rare form of authority Authority without domination People listen because something feels solid They follow because something feels real This is also why these individuals often reshape environments rather than adapt to them They dont rebel loudly They dont fight systems headon They simply refuse to participate in what is false and that alone destabilizes weak structures Their success looks effortless to outsiders but it is built on decades of inner labor No one saw failures that refined perception loneliness that sharpened discernment delay that prevented corruption And unlike early success this kind of success does not rot from the inside There is no midlife collapse here because there is nothing to escape from Their life makes sense to them That is the final reward Yung spoke of Not happiness not wealth not admiration inner coherence the feeling that your life belongs to you And once someone reaches this state nothing external can truly threaten them Loss hurts but does not destroy Criticism stings but does not derail Even death is faced differently not as interruption but as completion This is why Jung believed the rarest personality represents psychological evolution itself A human being who does not sacrifice the soul for speed or truth for approval If you have felt late out of sync misunderstood you may not be behind You may be early for a different kind of life And if this message resonates with you if you recognize yourself

        "plain_text": "Gemini in the next few days youre going to be hit with a wave of abundance thats going to make you very acutely aware of how good you are at creating abundance Um this is going to be a physical um material or a practical gain thats going to be highlighted Its going to be money Its going to be resources Its going to be opportunities Okay Youre entering a season where your independence and your prosperity are clearly rising The nine of pentacles is a card of the visible signs of progress Its going to be something that you can measure Its going to be something that you can point to and say objectively like its working you know So enjoy the gain Enjoy that abundance as its flowing in and let it change how you see yourself Okay Now Gemini this is a general reading for the one one portal Try to be open and receptive to whatever may come through during our time together I am merely the messenger and I ask you to connect directly with each of these cards and use your own intuition to take you beyond the details that I provide Wow look at that Look at all this water energy Wheel of Fortune a little five of swords sure three of wands 10 of pentacles Holy smokes and the high priestess Theres your intuition right there I think really spirits saying continue to follow your intuition because its obviously leading you in the right direction All right Now lets select our mystery card bonus card confirmation card This is a random card from the Smith Weight Tarot This is the factor infinite and unknown Were going to set it right here with Mr Dao the yinyang duck right there on top Were not going to look at that card until the very end It will tie everything together and it will give us the confirmation that we need at the end of the reading If at any moment during this message you feel like you might know what that card is put your prediction in the comments right below the video Now what were going to do is select our spirit animal card And for you we have the giraffe spirit and it says see the big picture Okay let me know in the comments your experiences with giraffes if youve ever seen one in person Um and what your what your intuition tells you about this giraffe Okay Um about the long the long neck right Being able to see above everything else and and see the bigger picture Yeah Um and also I kind of feel like theres some joke about um about the time it takes for a giraffe to swallow something I dont I dont know what that joke is but what popped into my head is that youre not so quick to accept everything that that um that you hear You know you dont swallow anything too quickly Like you youre going to be rather cautious And I think thats really the high priestess your intuition um guiding you and telling you not everything is what it seems Not everything is um can be taken at face value right So you have this ability to look kind of between the lines and to like to look in the shadows of things and look behind the appearances and really feel the subtle feelings Um especially when it comes to other people and what they tell you and that sort of thing Seeing the big picture but then also being able to um to not be gullible right to not swallow everything too quickly Um and to to use your own kind of higher discernment I think this is really really awesome Now as we look around the room now again let me know in the comments what youre feeling about this giraffe We have some good majors here right The High Priestess and the Wheel of Fortune Got some fire We certainly have water water water Um little bit of air makes sense And we have our our earth cards here and here and here which are also really extraordinary Not really a challenging card in the bunch right Except for the five of swords but obviously this is not that bad Um there are way worse cards to get I think that the five of swords here is saying that like youre skeptical that you youll see a nine of pentacles and youll see like youll see the the line going up and to the right right Youll see the visible signs of progress but youre still thinking Im not going to get carried away You know Im not going to um Im not going to rush to the bank yet Im just going to keep my eye on it Im not going to overreact You know youre not like a youre not doubting everything Youre not suspicious of everything but you you know youre cautious and youre a little bit skeptical And I think that is absolutely perfect right here This is the right amount of swords cards to have in a reading In any reading we got your intuition and you got your logical mind thats saying Okay you know what Were going to work together and were going to figure out exactly how to keep this thing going and make sure that what we are experiencing is real and and all this kind of stuff I think also the five of swords is saying that youve youve sometimes doubted your own abilities right Because the nine of pentacles to me is telling you that you can create abundance that you can create stability in your life And like I said at the beginning enjoy the enjoy the gain enjoy the harvest enjoy the abundance but also let it change how you see yourself Okay And now that we have the five of swords that statement makes a little bit more sense to me Um you know since it just kind of popped into my head Now it makes sense because its like you you didnt always see yourself as someone that that could create abundance you know or or that like you always you always knew that you were strong You always knew that you were capable but I wonder if there was a period of doubt about whether it would actually work or you know whether it would um whether it would it would bear any fruit Okay But this is something that is really truly strengthening your independence And I think its probably financial It could be something to do with property or an estate or or something uh in terms of legacy or generational wealth But I feel like theres a real real independence here Enjoy the comfort that youre that youre going to be experiencing especially that nine Ooh the nine of cups The nine of cups is happiness Um its not just financial increase but its an increase of the quality of your life Okay the nine the nines are the increase cards Now pardon me if I hit the cough button a few times during the reading today Okay All right So uh the nine of uh cups is the increase of the quality of life So your life is going to be visibly better Like okay your bank accounts going up Okay sure Your theres more money in your in your wallet Okay good But theres also more joy in your heart Theres also uh more of a of an abundance in your spirit You know like the quality of your life is increasing Um youre youre uh youre eliminating suffering for yourself and others right And and so theres this physical increase but then also this kind of spiritual or emotional increase or fulfillment and this kind of satisfaction or just like the um the uh the bliss you know Um its uh to me it feels like a deeper a deeper kind of love and a deeper kind of uh appreciation for yourself and for the people around you Its almost a contentment you know I think that what it is its its kind of like your wishes are coming true snorts Yeah Theyre showing visible signs of coming true And I think this overflows your heart with love Yeah And um its that joy of like of realizing that okay its its working and I can Im starting to feel like I can believe in this now And you know um its its going to feel almost overwhelmingly good Thats a pretty good problem to have isnt it Um share this good mood with other people Okay Share your good fortune with other people To me these two cards together is an empress life Its the best life thats thats taking shape So Gemini I think the one one portal is really going to be a significant turning point for you where something goes from being like well I dont know if its going to work to oh my gosh its working And not only is it sort of working but oh my gosh its working working working Um so theres no guilt over this right Theres no like apprehension Its like youre realizing that you can feel abundant that you can create abundance and stability in your life and also that youre allowed to feel emotional stability and emotional safety Happiness is like you know is kind of teaching you that its a youre youre allowed to be joyful Youre allowed to feel good and be happy about the life that youre creating Okay Um happiness is how the path should feel when its working See the nine of pentacles what youre doing is working Youre running a business Its working Its making money Okay It should feel good you know It should feel should feel extraordinary And I think that this is that that kind of satisfaction Yeah Down beneath the surface with the Ace of Cups though it kind of feels like its not always easy for you to to let yourself feel feel those those kinds of uh feelings right And maybe because theres that little five of swords there thats a little bit of that doubt or a little bit of that um I dont know almost like a feeling that no matter how much youre creating no matter how good youre objectively doing in life theres always this feeling of Im not doing enough or Im not good enough or even I dont deserve it So all that stuffs got to go right out the window because you do deserve it because youve created this Your efforts your virtues your sacrifices your sufferings have have created this success And with the Ace of Cups this is now your heart is opening Youre allowing this love to flow Okay This is really like um youre not youre not going to feel as if you have to kind of like quiet down your joy You know I dont want to I dont want anyone to see me celebrating you know youre going to celebrate out in the open with all your friends and family you know but at the same time youre going to see the bigger picture And I think the bigger picture really is that like all the success here is something for you to share Its really so my gosh its so awesome to have the nine of cups 10 of cups nine of pentacles 10 of pentacles because this is like the the bigger picture here is that uh the nines are the verbs This is like the happiness the success that keeps on happening you know This is the gain that just keeps on gaining the the the profit that keeps on building up you know but the tens are the bigger picture The tens are like what are you creating with all of this success and happiness Youre creating a a happy life Youre creating a legacy Youre creating generational wealth Youre creating you know a a stable environment for your family and friends and loved ones and you know your pets your plants your people Youre creating your best life And I think that this is the ideal that you have for your best life And this is you creating it doing the verb stuff the actual actions that are creating this this ideal form Okay I think its not always easy for you to to receive joy or to receive pleasure or to to receive even like recognition So to me it feels like this Ace of Cups is a its kind of you with your heart open being very very ready to receive Its your time right Its your youre due Youre overdue for some reception for some uh harvest and for some abundance coming in Okay And I think its because youre always the one thats giving out Youre always the one thats thats providing and putting in the work and putting in the hours and and making sacrifices on Im not going to have the ice cream today cuz Im Im working on my goals You know I think that this is now like youre realizing that youre youve got your your cup and uh youre ready to receive all the blessings All the blessings Yeah Um the four of pentacles back here I think is really nice too cuz this to me feels like stability You know to for one thing it feels like um you invested a lot in something and that investment um was a risk You had to roll the dice in a way You had to take what you had and put it into something else and hope that it gives you back more than what you put in or hope you dont like lose everything you know So whether this was you saying I believe in my dream Im going allin Or if this is you saying like I I believe in this in this business and Im going to Im going to commit myself to it or or going to school or I dont know what it was right It could be all sorts of things Um this is your willingness to to put in um the resources that you had Okay your power The four of pentacles is called power Your power is how you manage your resources Doesnt matter how much or how little you have Its how you manage those resources that really determine where youre going to go what youre going to do in life You know time effort energy money space and spirit How you manage those resources And I think that you you invested them you invested yourself into something that can grow into something bigger Its also telling me that you probably come from very humble backgrounds Um that maybe when you grew up you didnt have a lot The cupboards werent bare but they werent overflowing either And uh and so I think that its youre kind of in almost a a constant like not a not a poverty mindset but its just like you know how to live below your means And so even when even clears throat when you get super rich in life um youre still going to for the most part operate in the the old way you know the more frugal way and the really the more responsible way you know like your lifestyle isnt going to creep up um as your as your success rises in life because you know what its like to be um you know what its like to be maybe paycheck to paycheck Okay And I think thats given you this bigger picture thing too because when you have this I think I feel like its a windfall I feel like its suddenly I dont know suddenly something starts flowing in for you Yeah It would be very easy to just feel like I just got to spend it now My job is to just spend all this wonderful money thats coming in But thats not you You got the bigger picture Youre saying no Im going to be responsible Youre the sort of um youre the the caretaker of this in a way Yeah Its your responsibility to sort of maintain this and to make sure that there is something left or to make sure that it keeps growing for you know the future and make sure it lasts you you know into the into your retirement or into the next generations of your family or something And so um its not just your job to to spend all of this energy thats coming in but for you to preserve it Yeah And I and I think that you grew up in a way that that kind of taught you the the nec necessity of that or taught you the skills needed to do that Yeah Anyway um the 10 of cups here at the top this is all that this is that that family energy This is just like it really is the the overflowing uh life of just abundance And I think um in a way like the the complete absence of suffering and thats not going to ever be real right I mean a 10 is kind of like its an openended card there There really is no achieving perfection but it really is like peak emotions Okay peak peak emotions And I think that um you know you you can let your cup overflow but you got to stay conscious You can enjoy and indulge in what your uh the energy thats coming in but youre going to keep the bigger picture in mind Okay And most of all I think that this is you sharing and appreciating your people your family friends partners your pets Um watch out for overindulgence okay Dont drown yourself in what you enjoy Yeah this is something for you to savor but also keep the bigger picture in mind Its not your job to just spend everything thats coming in now Okay Its your job to keep this going Its your job to continue building Its your job to to think of the um think of how much good you can do with with whats coming in Yeah So its not about how much money youre youre making Its about like what youre doing with that money And youre doing something for the future Youre doing something that is going to um its going to benefit people beyond just you Yeah And I think thats um I think that really shows where your heart is and where your priorities are Now Wheel of Fortune moving forward spirit is going to continue to put the right people places and things on your path Spirit will line you up Spirit will set up the pins You got to knock them down Okay You got to keep knocking the pins down and youll continue to keep this wheel of fortune moving in your favor Okay Um once the wheel of fortune starts turning it can stop The thing is through our actions and our interactions with the universe we can keep this wheel going And this is the wheel of profit the wheel of prosperity the wheel of business right The wheel of fortune Um and so spirit will set up the pins and you got to knock them down And so in other words dont stop doing what youve been doing Okay um the practices the habits the techniques the behaviors the decisions um that have got you here Those are the ones that are going to take you even further So those are the ones that you got to lock in Dont stop doing what youve been doing Maybe the four of pentacles too is that idea of like you have very solid habits you have a very good rhythm to your life Now just because youre getting all this money and all this happiness dont let it throw you off your your habits or your rhythm or your routine Now of course you can celebrate and you can you know um you can make some indulgences here and there but overall see the big picture and stick to the routine Stick to the habit Okay Dont let this this uh this big energy change the way you do things because it is exactly the way youve done things that have has brought those nines here you know And I think thats the message of the wheel of fortune that we got to keep that wheel turning And we do that by showing up and being being in our best energy having our integrity and our virtue continuing to do hard things continuing to have the the sort of vision and the foresight and the insight um to you know to know how to engage because like I said spirits going to put the right people places and things on your path when and where you need them Its up to you to know how to interact with those things You got to be at the right place at the right time and you got to make the right decisions You know spirit can only set up the pins You got to knock them down All right Now that five of swords uh like I said this could be a little bit of doubt This could be a little bit of like kind of disbelieving that this is real you know and I think its important that you acknowledge out loud you are capable of this You know what I we should do is a well lets do an oracle of manifestation because see sometimes the five of swords is a little bit of this fear that um you know its its uh its a mistake you know were getting all this abundance all this energy but then theres just like no it cant be for me cuz Im Ive never had this before this cant be real you know and when we have those kinds of negative thoughts then we end up making poor decisions and then of course these things can leave So heres an oracle of manifestation for you We have inner peace Cultivate inner calm through meditation or mindful practices I let go and have faith Exactly Right Because what do I say about the five Anytime we get a five we start looking around for the four Whats the four of swords Meditation breath work mindfulness practices that will cultivate an inner calm This is a card of kind of like stress or doubt or like um you know some selfdefeating thoughts kind of thing right Our our inner tone is not all that kind sometimes Yeah Um snorts and uh I think that what this is is is literally saying like just calm calm your mind down choose to let go and choose to have faith and choose to believe that youve done this that youve created this and you are capable of this Well thats what the high priestess is asking you to to have faith hope and trust Shes saying Take my hand and follow me and we will go to Big Rock Candy Mountain Okay but youre saying I dont know if this is really for me or you know theres this kind of internal turmoil here What we need to do is the the the inner calm Cultivate that right The inner calm is the intercom with spirit snorts Yeah So meditation mindfulness practices let go and have faith Put that in the comments Say I let go and have faith because thats whats going to continue to push this forward for you Okay Um trusting in your intuition taking the hand of spirit and letting that high priestess guide you Okay The three of wands here is um is a card of virtue and its in the position of your environment and your relationships I feel like there may be a very challenging decision youre going to have to make very soon about a a person in your life Um and it may be that its going to have to be like a goodbye or even like even like maybe like a reprimand like I dont know if if you work with somebody that youre that you have a personal relationship with um or that you kind of got to be a little bit blunt with somebody okay Maybe its a friend maybe its a family member where um you cant just kind of let things keep going the way theyve been going that you need to kind of uh step up and and say things directly not in a cruel way but I think um I dont I dont necessarily think its a goodbye but I do think its its kind of um uh it has to be very direct Okay And its going to change the nature of the relationship a little bit But I think that its its important that you you start early with maintaining the boundaries and the expectations for yourself and for other people because especially when you start getting all this success coming in and this big wave of abundance thats coming in there going to be a lot of people coming out of the woodwork okay that are going to think they know you or theyre going to think that you owe them So I feel like this is really about you protecting your boundaries and enforcing your boundaries but also being willing to um being willing to do the difficult things because you believe that they are the right things Yeah And you know doing the right thing is not always the most difficult thing um the you know the um the high road is not always the most difficult road but I think sometimes um you know sometimes its going to seem like you are being kind of harsh but thats kind of in the eye of the beholder right um when you have to enforce a boundary with somebody that persons probably going to get pissed Okay if thats somebody with whom you need to enforce a boundary then thats probably somebody thats going to get mad about it Okay that does thats no reflection on you I think as long as you can honestly say that you are kind and respectful but also firm Um do what you need to do because youre youre protecting something here Its not just about you protecting yourself youre protecting um a a business a company a legacy an an estate or something You know what I mean Its a bigger its a bigger picture that youre that youre protecting Its not just you and your personal interests Uh the 10 of Pentacles here is that legacy It is um generational wealth Its the longterm plans and the longterm goals What is the bigger picture here for you Um I think thats something that you probably already know like what that is But the card is in this position of kind of the the jail the prison Um snorts its the card thats kind of locked up right now And the reason is I think because prior to to this energy coming in maybe you didnt quite believe that the future that you aspired to was actually possible Somethings happening in the next few days thats going to unlock this future And its going to show you visible signs of progress that this future is real Okay Its unlocking it from that that prison of doubt Okay Youre going to fully believe and I think you you have to already believe that this future is real Okay And the high priestess you know the high priestess is that faith that hope and that trust uh is the guiding force And so the the cards really are saying that the way forward for you okay the longterm trajectory your bigger arc here is all about you trusting yourself And maybe the five of swords is is kind of saying that in the past you havent always trusted your decisions or youve doubted yourself You know youve youve uh taken an action and then you kind of you know you secondguess it later on and stuff I think the high priestess is saying you need to learn to trust yourself cuz you know what youre doing and you know how to navigate this life and you know how to make good decisions So make the good decisions and dont second guessess yourself Listen inward okay Is your soul is whispering to you and I think that your your intuition is um is guiding you every second Okay Um I also feel that there is like there this has to do with that that person Again I think in a in a few days very soon theres going to be a change in the nature of a relationship in your life And I think that you probably already know who Im talking about because this is like youve already started to sense something about someone And I think that youre going to have to set a boundary or put your foot down somewhere very soon Okay Uh this is also a card that is saying you dont have to share everything with everybody that you need to again with that giraffe and the really long neck Um take your time when you when you swallow something you know dont dont just uh um dont be too gullible that youre just accepting and believing everything everybody tells you Uh so be a little bit skeptical Okay Trust in your own intuition you got a bad vibe about something you know give yourself some some uh room some meditation right Uh for clarity before you just kind of um swallow it hookline and sinker as they say right And so I think your intuition is is guiding you both into deeper prosperity but helping you to avoid the pitfalls and the calamities along the way Lets look at the mystery card Gemini Uh this is probably going to be some nasty swords cards I feel uh if you have a prediction put it in the comments Lets see Oh no Okay The judgment card Yeah this is kind of the similar vibe that I was thinking with the I was thinking with the swords cards Yeah theres going to be some kind of a theres going to be friction with this person I dont know who they are but their vibe is coming in pretty strong here I think that this is you trusting your own judgment about this person And I think if it has to be goodbye excommunication then thats what youre going to do And youre not going to let them convince you or feed you a story Youre not youre not just going to swallow that story like its truth you know Um theyre not just going to feed you a line Yeah Um snorts so you may have to kind of cut somebody off or or or um block somebody from your life but I think that this is a judgment that youre making about a relationship and you have to trust in your judgment because you are making the right call Okay Uh the judgment card is also a doorway card and I think that this is the moment the one one portal for you is the moment where your life shifts where you realize that youre now on the other side um youre on the other side of this this doorway where your future is is here you know uh that this prosperity is now Um and its to me its a pivotal moment Its the moment where you go from this just being like I hope its true or I hope its going to work to like wow its working Its more than working You know again with the visible sign of progress This is something that marks a a definite turning point in your life All

        "plain_text": "Hunter Hunter chapter 1 is a big deal Not just because its different from the anime episode one We all know that Togashi had a different beginning of Hunter Hunter that Madhouse Studio changed And Im not hating on Madhouse Studio They did a great job for Hunter Hunter 2011 But I want to say this Hunter Hunter Chapter 1 also fleshes out what Togashi had in mind all along when it comes to the Dark Continent when it comes to whos the main character and Jing Freaks and when it comes to Gone Freaks also being a main character and how they go back and forth which Ive been talking about for years So I know you guys are really excited but lets talk about it The first ever chapter in Hunter Hunter history Make sure you guys dont forget to like the video and subscribe to the channel Now many people believe the Dark Continent was a redcon after found Jing at the end of the Hunter Hunter anime but I beg to differ I actually believe Toashi was planning this since chapter 1 The first two pages says it all Strange beast and monsters secret treasure hordes undiscovered wealth mystical places and unexplored frontiers the mysterious unknown Theres magic in such words for those captivated by its spell aka Jing and Gon have been destined for the dark continent since the beginning This is not really explaining our hunter to hunter experience in the anime Its more so explaining our hunter to hunter experience thats going to be coming to us in the future in the dark continent Yes So I dont think what we saw with the on the world tree was a redcon I actually think it was planned since day one And I think said once found Jing which was which was initially Kites goal I do believe he already had this set in motion and thats why I believe Jinx will be the main character and then Goan will come back to take over as the main character Yes And I truly believe this first page of chapter 1 is describing everything Im talking about The second page goes on to say they are called hunters with Gon and Kite Like 2011 Madhouse anime of Hunter Hunter is some of the greatest adaptation of anime of manga Ive ever seen Honestly I think it actually makes Hunter Hunter a better series Yes cuz um Toashi has some very interesting word vomit and interesting uh artwork But I will say this when it comes to storytelling Toashis mind does surpass the studio And he wanted Kite to be a main figure in the beginning of Hunt to Hunter where 2011 is like Yeah well just make him a main figure when the Chimera Anarch starts Which I get what theyre trying to say Theyre not trying to confuse readers but I think it would have been so cool seeing Kite again Its like walking dead when you saw Morgan again So I feel like they really dropped the ball there but they have done an amazing job so I cant say much So the beginning of the Hunter Hunter chapter is gone He catches the master of the old swamp It says Five grown men together couldnt do what this kid just did And his aunt Meto knowing this said this is the only way she was going to let him take the Hunter exam Yeah she thought it was impossible as a kid but of course he achieved it And of course he she should have known hes the son of Jing Freaks Of course hes gonna achieve this Yes its even stated that Goon has the same gleam in his eye as Jing And Mito is shocked that Goon wants to be a hunter when she kept his father a secret Like honestly a big reason on why I believe Jing will be a main character in the Dark Continent is because of how big Jing is in the first ever chapter Like the lore that Jing has in the first ever chapter gives him the only right to become the main character after Gone in my opinion We also get a flashback 3 years before Gon goes to take the Hunter exam Hes saved by Kite This was shown in the beginning of the Kam anarch in the anime of 2011 And I think it did a shame to Kites character Yes Kite was still an emotional moment for Goan and everything but I think that his his importance definitely was undervalued I think it should have been in episode one to make us as fans really gravitate towards Kite So to talk about this moment music Kite kills a fox bear with a cub because of course it tried to kill Gone as a kid And he says if you try to kill a human like a true hunter he has to take down the animal I think this is really cool to show also how savage the world is in a sense and how people underestimate animals like because we live in kind of cities and areas where theres not that many animals wild animals but wild animals will    you up guys And I love how Kite punches Gorn for wandering around Snake Beach forest this time of year It could and saying that you could have been killed And hes kind of pissed off that he had to kill a fox bear You could feel Kites anger and his passion when it comes to hunting He doesnt hunt for fun He hunts because it has to be done Its a profession and he doesnt want to kill aimlessly We even see Kite highlighting the territorial mark of a fox bear when shes with her cub and mentions the lies clearing out till welping season is passed Yes Kite is showing the details of what Gohan ignored because Kite believes he didnt have a father in his life Hes like Didnt your father bother teaching you anything Remember Goan had no father as Jing was a deadbeat And Kite mentions the squirrel giving him a warning and thats the only reason he knew that something was going on And now he got a pointless kill to his credit And Gohan tells Kite he has no dad or mom and lives with his aunt And Kite kind of feels guilty for being too hard on Goan and gives him some antiseptic for his injured arm which I found pretty interesting Kite then tells Goon hes going to put down the cub as its better a scenario than letting it starve to death And might have some hate towards humans for seeing his mother killed by one But Goon wants to take care of the cub showing great uh love Goon has for the baby And honestly I think this is really good emotional intelligence Like he does not want this young animal to be killed Then we see Goan saying he will take care of it as its scratching at his arm Like honestly hes a great kid with compassion and sympathy for animals and I loved it And then Kite sees Jing in Gons eye Remember I talked about how Gon has the same gleam in his eye like Jing Yes Kite sees it Kite then explains hes looking for Jen and pretty much this is a big lead as he just found one in Goon and tells Goon that Jing is his teacher He drilled the basics of hunting and final challenge for Kite is to find Jing Kite also says Jing is the best hunter and theres no one like him Remember Nero said Jing was a top five Nen user and his ability to copy Nen as a talent not his Nen makes me believe yeah Nzur wasnt lying The hype is real when it comes to Jing Kite then lets Goan know that Jing is alive even though his aunt Mito wants to protect Gohan and says all good hunters are good with animals and pretty much says the blood is telling when it comes to Goan and it speaks volume when it comes to potential that Goan has which is pretty insane as we saw during the Pito versus adult Goan fight how much potential he truly had to avenge Kite Also Kite leaving Jings hunter license was amazing Why didnt the anime show this in the episode one Like I still dont understand Like what a fail from a great 2011 anime series which is pretty much perfect Like why not just do this to make it even more perfect Go then tells Co the cub of the fox bear hes going to be a hunter And its kind of like a feelgood moment And pretty much hes I honestly would love to see Coin the dog cartoonet after years during Gos return with Nen I think thatd be super cool to see in a super adult version of Coin the Fox bear Then we see Gohan tell the fox bear cub K hunter do things animals hate and K as a king of the forest cant be friends with the hunter aka dont follow me I love the emotional intelligence by Goon trying to tell him to stay away because he knows he does he wants to do this journey by himself like Goan is very mature for his age Goan also says family comes second when it comes to being a hunter as Mito finally admits that Jing is Goons father Thats something only Jing would say And Gorn recalls Kite who motivated him to find his father Jing and follow in his footsteps The hardest challenge that Kite said he had was to find Jing And after being a hunter that was his final test And I think pretty much growing got motivation for that goal to find Jing as his main purpose And he found Jing at the end of the Anti Hunter anime But theres definitely a manga guys And Dark Continent is on its way I also love how Aunt Meto admits Jing never abandoned Go but was forced to give Go away I I love that theory that Goon might be a calamity like Alaka or has to do with something that happened in Jings hunter alive maybe in her content Im not too sure As Goon says he already knew because Mito never looks in his eye when lying Great emotional intelligence by Gon Goon states he will come back a great hunter to Meito which angers the other applicants who were like these guys are pretty much scrubs but theyre like yo why is this guy talking so confident like does he not know what hes getting himself into Thats the energy I got Then they also try to give Goan a reality check saying he should be happy if he even survives the exam as Goans journey begins to be a hunter Find Jing and of course we see the captain of the ship muttering its going to be rough as he is one of the examiners actually and the exams already started I think this chapter of Hunter Hunter was a great start to this chapter So what are my final thoughts My final thoughts is this chapter is going to be legendary till the end of Hunter Hunter if we even get an ending of Hunter Hunter But they did promise us 50 chapters The reason why I say its going to be legendary is because we do know some major things Jing Freaks is about to go crazy right now on this trip to the dark continent and hes about to be the main character Secondly if Go comes back with his end back definitely is going to be really cool to see of course him leaving again the island that he was born and raised and of course leaving the King of Forests and going back to of course this go to the dark continent Maybe he brings Killer there as well Im not too sure Then of course Kite Kite is still alive guys Kite got reborn and we know Kite was a major factor in the chapter 1 So I tr truly believe seeing a moment of Jing Kite and going to the dark continent would be my favorite moment in Hunt onto history And I think chapter 1 would definitely make me hype because of all the foundation it laid out Now I do want to say this Seeing Jings flashback is going to be think make me think of chapter one too So Jings flashback is something that I really want Toashi to give us Please Toashi give us the secrets of Hunt At least just spoil me yo Like just spoil me I know we have 50 chapters promise but just spoil me cuz I want to know And guys if you like videos like this where I highlight and analyze chapters of Huntter I might do every single chapter in Hunter Hunter but it Ill only do that if it gets 1000 likes If this video gets 1000 likes it shows that you Hunt Hunter fans still want me to analyze the entire series up until the 50 chapters come out But if it doesnt get 1000 likes I will not do that because that was a lot of work to reread Hunter Hunter Ive reread it and rewatched it so many times guys "

could be from Sirius cuz we have both star I mean both cards coming out that are from the star system named Sirius Okay so what we have at the bottom of the deck is good intentions And then what flipped out was saving humanity And you know what behind that I have to say graduation And this is perfect because so Sirius was um is a star system that back in the day they had the best intentions you know to save humanity to help humanity in some way But what happened is they got very obsessed with it Um and now you know theyre realizing that um the way to save humanity is to become that example You cant save anybody but you can become the example that people can look up to or become that lighthouse for people is what Im saying And Im this is the vibe Im getting from you This is the message coming through for you today Theres something here about you having the best intentions in the world to save humanity or Im getting here someone wanting to save a family member Okay in specific or wanting to save your family in general So um right now you are graduating okay and this is whats happening You are realizing that I cannot save anybody I can only become that example and this is what youve done Im talking to someone who you have put the world of sorry the weight of the world on your shoulders wanting to save everyone okay you have the best intentions to do so but the there was a problem here it was like God had to show you like you cant save anyone but you can become that example that people can look to okay and thats what youre doing Im talking to someone whos doing this okay um youre going through an activation right Wow And behind that we have activated earth too Mother Gia has been helping to activate you Okay Im talking to someone who gets activated through mother Gia Whether you watch things online about animals or you watch things about um the earth or something um or whether you do this out in the physical you know Um either way you get activated through mother Gia Okay Whether I dont know if youre listening to frequencies or whatnot I dont know But you have been activated Your light body has been activated Okay And this is what youre doing You you have been devoted to saving people but now youre devoted to saving yourself and becoming that example making your life a moving prayer Thats whats happening here This is how youre saving humanity um is realizing that youre not able to save humanity Um but you can be that example and by being that example you are saving humanity Do you see what Im saying Um okay So make your

intentions Mary motive You have the best intentions with everything you do Im talking to someone You have beautiful intentions Um okay prayer I spread peace This is how you are saving humanity Youre becoming a moving prayer Youre making your life a moving prayer And this is what is healing your connections You guys for someone in specific I just have to say really quick okay This could be your family or a family member that you have been wanting to help and its been hard for you to move forward because you see yourself transforming and you youre just you just want to help them as well And Im talking to someone who has let go Youve let go of the res here and you just became the example and by doing this you are saving your family Okay thats for someone in specific For others of you this is humanity in general Okay we do have family tree though Okay we have family tree coming out This is expansion This is legacy clears throat And then we have emotional desert coming out here for you And Im getting that you could have had to pull back your emotions from your family in specific or whoever youre wanting to save here Its like you had to cut your emotions out of it and leave your emotions out of it and just become that and just become that example And by doing this like I said youre moving forward here The old has crumbled We have the tower Its over Youre moving forward now with the eight of wands Okay And again with the this making a wish There you are Theres something coming in here that you wished for as a child that youre seeing come to fruition now Wow And again

fruition and youve released the outcome of this of how its going to happen Youre like I dont know how its going to happen but I dont I just know its going to happen And youve released it This is why

after a time of having to be alone for a while and figure this out and realize I cant save anybody but I can save myself and become that example for everyone around me And by doing that you are saving everyone And again not one person can save humanity but you if you become that example you invite others to join the fight with you and then together you will save humanity It you this is how it happens I mean and this is how it is happening This is beautiful So youre making your life a moving prayer here  screaming  Okay Riri laughter Okay can you get one of these spirit Thats way too many

spirit Yeah  Yeah Wow you guys  Jesus Okay so you have let something go with the three of wands at the bottom Okay The seven of what you let go of was the seven of swords Something that was just

kind of magic here Okay Youve learned to let something go And this was feeling like you had to save people Okay And you have become some kind of beautiful example here And you are making your life a moving prayer Now this is the message And because of that you are saving people by being that example for people Youre this is how youre saving everyone And its not that youre saving everyone Youre learning how to save yourself and become that example But by doing that its like youre inviting others to join this fight with you And together you will save humanity Thats what Im getting Okay What I want to do really quick before you go you guys Um Oh my god Twitter Oh god How did that happen you guys I turned my back for what 20 minutes  Yeah you did that didnt you Thats all right Its okay I will clean it up Oh you guys Twitter Twitters having a dust bath but shes doing it laughter right next to everything that I have here And its just its got It got dirt in there Its okay Ri Were just going to get one I always say that huh This is what it is You put some worry to bed You put it this back into balance Okay The twin flame is balanced to me Okay And theres some kind of worry that youve been worried I I swear about the collective about saving people This could be specific family members or friends of yours that you have been worried about saving and you finally put it to bed and you put things back into balance Thats what it is You were almost obsessed with saving people Okay And youre not anymore Youre learning that I just can save myself and then become that example for others And in turn this is what youre doing is you are saving people by doing this because like I said youre in youre inviting others to join this fight with you Um and together boom Okay We cant do anything by ourselves And people have to make a choice to live for themselves as well So I think youre learning that My hair is crazy I dont care right now Um thank you guys for accepting me exactly how I am and not judging me I really appreciate that the most you guys because I have a low selfesteem and it helps me to know that I have people like you guys that dont give a about that stuff They just want to hear the message and I appreciate that a lot because it makes me feel so much better It really does cuz then I dont have to come on here and worry about physical stuff so much You know what I mean which Im learning to yes to take care of myself but not to overdo it not to be so worried about how I look and um stuff like this you know All right thats just a side note Okay so for um yeah for some of you guys this is family members that youve been trying to save and youre learning that I can just be the example for them but by doing that you are saving your family by doing that For others of you this is humanity on a bigger scale wanting to save the world and putting way too much pressure on yourself And youre learning that hey I can just be the example and send an invitation to others Thats all I can do And by doing this you are saving people Okay this is the message Um Ill see you in the next one Please let me know how this resonated if you feel like You dont have to Um Ill see you in the next one No worries Okay love you "

        "plain_text": "If youre here watching this the Manard has found you And it means way more than you think This isnt random and its not accidental The Menade doesnt tap just anyone It reaches the ones who slipped out of the worlds spell without even trying The ones who started seeing through the noise long before they had the words for it Right now most people are trapped inside the loops of the world but youve been living outside of it The monad is the original spark of consciousness the quiet intelligence behind everything youve ever felt but never fully understood And when it reaches you it has a reason to Youre being activated now And this means that there are things you need to know things that explain why you were found what this shift means and why your life hasnt felt random for a long time The word infiltrator sounds intense but spiritually its a title of honor Youre not breaking into the world Youre blending into it with light You move quietly but your presence shifts environments in ways most people will never notice consciously Youre part of a silent transformation You live among the unaware not because theyre wrong But because your energy stabilizes rooms inspires clarity and wakes people who are already close to remembering themselves Infiltrators dont force awakening They spark it by existing This path isnt about superiority Its about subtle impact Real change starts from the inside And you are placed exactly where the mon needed awareness to live in human form And once you accept this the next truth becomes obvious Infiltrators all share the same unmistakable signs Signs youve carried your entire life Authentic attunement shows up in patterns not labels And if the monitor has reached you these signs will feel like your biography The first and the most obvious indicator is cognitive separation While everyone follows the crowd you naturally step back and see the patterns behind their actions You dont copy the world You observe it When you stop matching the world you start understanding it The second indicator is early spiritual depth You thought about meaning existence and purpose long before anyone else your age even knew what those words meant You werent pretending to be wise You just came in with a different baseline And the third indication is the intuition that hits with quiet accuracy You sense the truth of people and situations before anything happens No theatrics just inner certainty that proves itself over and over Intuition is the echo of the self you were before this life These three indicators are the signature of the infiltrator consciousness The monad never reaches someone because they failed fell behind or wandered too far from who they were meant to be It reaches someone because their inner compass is ready to be adjusted back toward its true direction You havent been drifting because youre lost Youve been drifting because your consciousness has been stretching growing outgrowing versions of yourself you no longer fit into And when that happens the monet steps in not to control you but to realign you gently with the path you were always meant to walk Sometimes the most awake souls are the ones who find themselves slipping into repetition Not because theyre asleep but because the world around them pulls constantly Responsibilities routines environments and people can all subtly distort your inner direction until you dont even realize how far youve drifted from your core The mon doesnt treat this as a crisis It treats it as a sign that youre ready for refinement Awareness doesnt collapse when you drift It expands when you return If youve been questioning your purpose secondguessing your decisions or feeling like youre circling the same inner themes again and again this isnt a breakdown Its a reset point The Monards presence is a subtle but unmistakable pivot a rerouting back into the reality that fits you not the one you settled into Think of it as a quiet hand on your shoulder turning you ever so slightly toward the direction youve been sensing but avoiding the direction that requires a newer version of you to fully step into This isnt punishment The monad doesnt operate through guilt fear or shame It operates through clarity When it arrives it does so with the intention of pointing you toward a higher alignment not judging you for the temporary detour it took to get here Correction from the moment isnt a consequence its a calling If youre feeling drawn into this message its because a part of your inner world is finally ready to shift And the mon is simply illuminating the path you were already walking in the dark And once this shift begins another truth becomes unavoidable The reason most people never feel this signal even when its right in front of them The manad doesnt hide its signal from the world The world is just loud enough to drown it out for most people The majority of individuals are synchronized with the rhythms of survival schedules expectations obligations identities they inherited without questioning When your entire awareness is anchored to the external world it becomes nearly impossible to notice the deeper pulse underneath it Not because they lack depth but because their attention has never been trained to look inward long enough to recognize a higher frequency moving through them For many life becomes a constant loop of reacting to responsibilities to emotions to relationships to pressures that have nothing to do with the true self In that loop subtle signals feel irrelevant and internal shifts feel like background noise They may feel small moments of intuition strange coincidences or glimpses of something deeper But without space to reflect those moments dissolve into the flow of daily life They dont identify the signal because theyve never paused long enough to differentiate it from their thoughts But heres the truth Most people never consider Not noticing the signal doesnt mean someone is spiritually asleep There are people with extraordinary depth who simply havent learned to recognize whats speaking to them They feel the nudge but attribute it to chance They sense the pull but label it imagination They hear the whisper but assume its their mind wandering The Moner doesnt choose the loudest mind It chooses the one willing to listen The reason you felt the signal isnt because youre better Its because your awareness has reached a stage where silence speaks louder than noise Youve become sensitive to the subtle shifts the internal movements the quiet realignments that most people overlook You dont just think you observe your thinking You dont just react you question the reaction You dont just exist You notice the layers beneath existence That level of inner attention creates the opening the mon needs And now that youve recognized the signal the mon can show you something deeper Not just why you were reached but what your role inside this world truly looks like when the activation fully unfolds When you look back at your life theres a pattern you cant ignore The friction the instability the phases where it felt like nothing flowed easily for you the way it seemed to for others And for a long time you may have interpreted those experiences as signs that something was wrong with you or that you were somehow falling behind But what you went through wasnt punishment karma or cosmic correction It was exposure Exposure to the density of the world you were meant to infiltrate Most people move through life seamlessly because they match the system theyre in Theyre synchronized with its expectations its structures its narratives But you werent built to blend in that way You were built to remain conscious inside a world that operates unconsciously And that type of awareness naturally bumps against environments that are misaligned with your inner truth That friction was never a sign of failure It was simply the difference between your frequency and the frequency of the spaces you were walking through Every place you felt out of place every relationship where you couldnt shrink yourself enough to fit every period of instability that pushed you out of complacency None of these were random They were signals that the life around you wasnt a match for who you truly were Friction isnt the universe blocking you Its the universe redirecting you While others could tolerate patterns that drained them you couldnt While others fused with environments that dulled them something in you resisted That resistance was your higher awareness refusing to collapse into the density you were sent here to observe You were never meant to adapt perfectly to the world You were meant to navigate it with a different level of clarity And the isolation you experienced at certain points that wasnt abandonment It was recalibration When the world around you became too noisy or too heavy separation became necessary so your inner signal could rise above the distortion Isolation was where your alignment strengthened And instability was where your discernment sharpened The reason it felt like you lived a life of disruption is because infiltrators arent allowed to fall asleep inside the systems theyre meant to understand The monad kept you awake by ensuring you never fully merged with the illusions around you It pushed you through experiences that shaped sensitivity into wisdom resilience into clarity and hardship into recognition And now that youve survived the density you can finally understand the deeper truth Not every soul experiences this level of friction only the ones who werent meant to fully integrate into the system to begin with There are two types of souls moving through this reality Those who integrate completely into the system and those who remain attuned to something beyond it Understanding the difference is crucial to understanding your own path Integrated souls are not lesser or asleep They simply resonate strongly with the physical world Their consciousness blends naturally with the structures of society the identities the roles the ambitions the expectations They find comfort in fitting into frameworks and their growth comes from refining their human experience They are fully immersed in the collective rhythm and because of that they rarely question the deeper architecture behind it Their journey is inward but their awareness stays within human context Attuned souls are different They live inside the system but they never fully become part of it Theres always a part of their consciousness observing analyzing sensing the subtleties behind everything unfolding around them They feel the emotional temperature of a room before they hear a word They sense when a path is misaligned before logic catches up They know when something feels true even if they cant explain it Attuned souls navigate the world while remembering they are not defined by it This partial resonance with source level awareness creates a very distinct experience Attuned souls often feel older than their age deeper than their environment and slightly out of sync with the mainstream current of society Theyre not detached Theyre simply operating from an inner reference point most people dont have access to Their choices reflect clarity rather than conditioning Their instincts come from intuition rather than imitation Integrated souls build structure Attuned souls create meaning Integrated souls move through life based on what they were taught Attuned souls move based on what they recognize Integrated souls fuse with the story Attuned souls question the author And being attuned doesnt make you detached from humanity It makes you more connected to its potential Youre not outside the world looking down on it Youre walking beside it with a perspective that sees what it can become not just what it currently is This difference isnt a hierarchy Its a function It explains why you always felt like your consciousness was tuned to a different frequency Why you couldnt commit wholeheartedly to identities that others embraced Why your intuition often guided you away from paths that seemed logical on the surface Your alignment with the monet means youre an attuned soul someone designed to remain aware inside a world that teaches people to forget And that awareness positions you for the next revelation The monet has been preparing you for the real purpose behind your inner separation and outer sensitivity One thing almost every infiltrator eventually realizes is that their life contains moments that shouldnt have worked out but did Situations that should have ended badly but somehow shifted Paths that should have closed yet opened at the last second Most people call this luck but for an attuned soul those moments are signs of something far more intentional operating beneath the surface When you move in alignment with the monid your path doesnt become perfect It becomes protected not in a dramatic or supernatural way but in the form of timing redirection intuition and invisible guard rails that keep you from collapsing into environments that would suffocate your awareness Youve likely experienced moments when things fell apart just in time or when you left a situation moments before it revealed the truth behind it You werent being saved from danger You were being steered away from versions of yourself that no longer matched who you were becoming This type of protection isnt loud It doesnt announce itself and it doesnt make your life frictionless Instead it creates conditions where even the disruptions serve you When the monet protects you the world rearranges itself before you even understand why You may notice that people who werent meant for your journey quietly drift away or opportunities you were never supposed to take suddenly lose their appeal What looks like coincidence is actually precision Many infiltrators report strange near misses situations where one small shift in timing would have changed everything Yet the timing always favored them They move out of a job right before the environment becomes toxic They avoid a plan that later turns out disastrous They meet the right person at the exact moment it matters They cross paths with knowledge they werent even looking for These arent random events They are the Monads way of shaping your trajectory so you never fully collapse into a reality that wasnt built for you You are protected not because youre fragile but because your awareness is needed You carry a consciousness the world quietly recalibrates around That guidance has always been with you long before you knew what to call it And now that youre becoming aware of it youll see it everywhere One of the strangest experiences for attuned souls is realizing that their presence alone can shift people Sometimes in ways that dont make immediate sense Youve probably been in situations where someone reacts defensively to something you didnt even say or they become unusually nervous curious or even inspired just by being around you This isnt because youre intense or intimidating Its because your awareness activates dormant parts of people they havent learned to face yet Awakening energy acts like a mirror When you stand in your own clarity even quietly it highlights internal contradictions in others Places where theyre not honest with themselves places theyve neglected emotions theyve bypassed or truths theyve never acknowledged You dont trigger their chaos you trigger their clarity And clarity can be uncomfortable for those who arent ready to see themselves without distortion Sometimes youll notice people become defensive or dismissive without understanding why Theyre not reacting to you Theyre reacting to the part of themselves that wakes up in your presence Others may feel a sudden admiration like they sense something in you theyve been missing within themselves Some will project confusion curiosity or even fascination because your energy feels familiar in a way their mind cant place This dynamic isnt negative Its a natural function of a tuned consciousness Youre not here to push people or correct them You simply bring a depth that disrupts the autopilot many live on For some this is unsettling For others its inspiring But for almost everyone its unforgettable People remember you for reasons they cant articulate because theyre responding to the shift you activate not the words you speak This is part of what makes infiltrators so important You dont wake people up by lecturing them or leading them You wake them up by existing authentically in a world that trains people to hide from themselves Your presence activates recognition in others that they werent consciously searching for And even if they resist it the impact remains Youre not triggering people because theres something wrong with you Youre triggering people because theres something awakening in them The biggest misunderstanding attuned souls carry is the belief that feeling deeply is a flaw For most of your life you may have seen your emotional sensitivity your perceptiveness or your intensity as something that made you too much for people or too reactive for the world But what the monet has been trying to show you all along is that your sensitivity is not a malfunction Its the operating channel through which higher awareness moves When you navigate reality with heightened sensitivity youre not overreacting Youre picking up what others miss You sense shifts in people before they express them You recognize when something feels off long before the evidence appears You feel truth even when its inconvenient And you feel misalignment before it fully forms This isnt paranoia or weakness Its attunement Sensitivity is the ability to perceive what reality tries to hide Most people require physical proof words or clear signals before they accept that something is wrong or something is right But infiltrators operate differently Your inner system notices patterns intentions emotional undercurrents and energetic inconsistencies with almost painful clarity While others move based on surface level cues you move based on a deeper resonance that comes from the monad using your awareness to read the environment Your sensitivity was never meant to be numbed It was meant to guide you It was designed to be the compass that keeps you from merging with the wrong people the wrong paths and the wrong timelines It protects you just as much as it reveals to you The reason it feels overwhelming at times is because you are interacting with layers of reality most people dont even realize exist And the more you honor this sensitivity instead of suppressing it the more clearly the Monard can move through you Youll start to recognize that your emotional depth isnt emotional chaos Its calibration Your intuition isnt random Its refined Understanding this shifts everything What once felt like a burden starts feeling like a gift because you finally see that your sensitivity is the very thing that keeps you on the trajectory designed for you Its your radar your guidance your alignment mechanism And now that you know this youre ready to understand the larger truth The world is shifting because of people exactly like you Its tempting to believe that global transformation only happens through extraordinary figures historical revolutions or largecale collective movements But in truth every major shift in human consciousness has always started with individuals who awakened quietly not with noise not with fanfare but with an internal shift so profound that it radiated into the world around them without effort You are one of those individuals And whether you realize it yet or not your awareness is part of the foundation of a new paradigm forming beneath the surface of everyday life Your presence creates change long before your words do People notice something different about you even when they cant articulate it They become more reflective more honest more aware around you They question beliefs they never questioned before They feel safer expressing things they normally suppress You bring clarity into spaces that are muddled And you bring a sense of coherence into environments that feel fractured This is because youre not just interacting with the world Youre subtly reorganizing it through the way you perceive it A single awakened mind shifts the frequency of everyone it encounters And the most powerful part of this is that you dont need to do anything dramatic You dont need to convert anyone You dont need to preach prove or persuade Infiltrators are not here to force transformation Theyre here to embody it Your alignment becomes the reference point that others unconsciously calibrate to Your grounded presence becomes the contrast that exposes what is inauthentic Your intuition becomes a ripple that encourages others to trust their own inner signals Without trying you make people more aware of themselves and that alone changes the collective trajectory When you choose inner clarity you challenge the illusion that keeps people asleep When you reject the narratives that dont align with your truth you dissolve their influence on the collective When you follow your intuition instead of fear you normalize a new way of navigating life The world is shifting because people like you show that another way of being is possible Not through grand gestures but through consistent authenticity Awakening spreads not through noise but through resonance Your journey your healing your insights your growth They dont end with you They radiate outward into your relationships your choices your presence your silence your energy The monad doesnt choose random people to carry this level of attunement It chooses those who can influence reality not through domination but through coherence You anchor a frequency that the world quietly adjusts to without even realizing it So when you think your role is small understand this The collective unconscious is shifting because individuals like you refuse to fall back asleep The illusion weakens each time someone chooses awareness over automatic behavior The grid of human consciousness reorganizes itself every time someone like you embodies truth instead of imitation Youre not here accidentally Youre not here as a passive observer You are part of the mechanism that is actively shaping what humanity becomes next Your existence is not symbolic It is catalytic And the world you move through is already transforming because you are in it And still much of your influence will remain unseen And thats exactly how its meant to be The manard doesnt move through spectacle It works through stillness through presence Youll shift energy without trying Youll speak softly and leave people questioning their entire framework Thats not charisma Thats frequency Thats spiritual gravity What begins in you doesnt end in you Someone you affect will go on to affect someone else And the chain continues The monet thinks in timelines not moments What feels like a personal shift is part of a much larger blueprint Youre not just healing Youre opening hidden doors in the field of reality itself So trust that pull you feel the urge to go deeper the sense that youre being watched over If youre still watching Id like to thank you for your attention If you enjoyed the content and

by the Lord Each struggle is a thread in the tapestry of your life story Embrace this awakening It heralds the dawn of your purpose Know that your voice will rise from the ashes of doubt lighting the way for others It is through your journey that you will guide souls seeking refuge A new identity bears itself before you cloaked in divine authority This revelation is not meant to dwell in the shadows It is a call to action With each realization comes empowerment igniting the fire within your soul The trials you faced have unleashed a warrior of God If this resonates deeply with you do not walk away just yet Stay with me for what is to come will change everything Your silence has concealed a powerful gift one that now demands to be shared Comment below with the words I carry the silence

sorrow each feeling of neglect is a prelude to your divine unveiling The threads of your story are intricately woven waiting for the right moment to reveal their design As you stand on the threshold of transformation I invite you to breathe in anticipation a divine promise awaits one that extends far beyond your current understanding Next I will unveil the hidden code he left for you waiting just

abandoned but this abandonment is a divine law shaping your destiny You are not alone in your suffering My dear every chosen one has walked through this valley of shadows This pain weaves a thread through time connecting your heart to a greater tapestry God has allowed this silence for it is here you find strength beyond measure In those moments of isolation you were not forgotten but being prepared for your mission Like a seed buried in the dark earth you are being fashioned into something mighty This challenge feeds the fire within you igniting your spirit to rise Remember the trials

wondered if God had simply turned his face away from you But now at this sacred moment clarity glimmers through the darkness Those trials were not random They were the foundation of your awakening

moments when you felt forsaken the Lord was preparing you for greater revelations Rejection was not meant to break you but to set apart your spirit You needed these experiences to unveil your true

scars are testaments of survival Each one a badge of honor In this awakening trust that the Lords hand is guiding you toward a lightfilled horizon Each betrayal you faced shifts into a signpost

of existence Imagine yourself as David standing before Goliath knowing you are destined to overcome In this moment the fire has burned away the illusions revealing the truth that has always been yours

surging within you The awakening is only the beginning Liberation awaits tantalizingly close Are you ready to embark on the next phase of your transformation A divine dance of faith and action is

echo of rejection now sings the harmony of acceptance The sacred recognition of your presence here is the key to your destiny Embrace this moment of proclamation for it is your time You stand at the threshold prepared to step into the fullness that awaits You have crossed the threshold emerging from the cocoon of isolation Like the phoenix arising from the ashes your transformation is profound and beautiful You have shed the past and its shackles becoming a beacon of hope You are the healed sign a testament to resilience and divinity The fire that once consumed you now serves as your crown

imbued with strength and purpose It wraps around you like an armor forged in the fires of trials overcome This mark upon your spirit signals a hidden vow made before you breathe your first As fire

        "plain_text": "chosen one You are not here by accident You did not stumble into this moment by chance curiosity or routine Heaven has ordered this exact intersection in time because your spirit is ready to hear what is about to be released Something has been stirring within you a quiet knowing a holy pressure a sense that your season is shifting and that is because it is This is divine timing orchestrated beyond the visible aligned in the unseen Chosen one you are standing at the edge of a supernatural breakthrough What has been delayed is about to accelerate What was hidden is about to surface What you carried in faith through seasons of silence is now being answered with movement provision and elevation Scripture reminds us that the vision awaits an appointed time And though it tries it will surely come as written in Habachok 23 That appointed time is now pressing into your life Anointed one This is not just about finances It is about assignment A great transfer of wealth is approaching because heaven trusts your heart your integrity and your obedience God does not release resources without purpose And you have been prepared for this moment As you listen let your spirit open Let expectation rise What follows is not information It is activation Heaven is speaking and your season is changing Chosen one The signs have been surrounding you quietly persistently sometimes so subtle that only your spirit could recognize them Sudden opportunities appearing where there were none Unexpected changes disrupting routines you once depended on Doors closing without explanation while others open effortlessly almost mysteriously These are not random fluctuations of life These are confirmations This is how heaven signals that a season has ended and another has begun I have lived through this kind of transition myself when what once felt stable started to feel misaligned When comfort began to lose its peace At the time it felt unsettling But looking back every closed door was mercy every disruption was direction Chosen one your season is shifting You are stepping into a new realm of abundance purpose and responsibility And I want to be very clear with you because clarity is protection This is not only about money Wealth is simply the visible expression of something deeper that is happening first in the unseen Before anything changes in your bank account your business or your resources something shifts in your spirit This is how it has always worked Scripture reminds us that what is seen was made from what is unseen And so if you are sensing movement internally if something in you feels awakened restless expectant that is because the transfer has already begun at the spiritual level Chosen one Many people miss this moment because they are waiting for physical proof before they believe But those who are chosen learn to recognize heavens movement before the manifestation arrives I remember a season in my own life where nothing on the outside looked promising Bills were due progress was slow Yet inside there was a calm that did not match the circumstances That calm was not denial It was preparation That is the same peace you are feeling now It is the spirit whispering This is temporary Be ready That inner knowing is not imagination It is alignment One of the first signs that the great transfer is approaching is this unshakable inner certainty You cannot fully explain it to others You may not even have words for it yourself but deep down you know It feels like standing on the edge of something significant something holy It is the same kind of knowing described when the vision waits for its appointed time written in Habachok 23 It does not rush It does not panic It arrives exactly when you are ready to carry it And chosen one that time is drawing near for you Along with this knowing often comes divine discontent Things that once satisfied you no longer do Work that once felt meaningful now feels empty Conversations that once energized you now drain you This can feel confusing even painful especially when others around you seem comfortable staying where they are But hear me clearly Discontent is not rebellion It is elevation It is heaven Loosening your grip on what cannot go with you into the next season I remember having to walk away from situations that made sense on paper but felt wrong in my spirit At the time it felt like loss Later I realized it was protection Chosen one The old must fall away so the new can enter This is not punishment It is preparation Abundance requires capacity and capacity is created by release That is why you are being stripped of habits mindsets and even relationships that no longer align with who you are becoming This is how you are prepared to carry wealth with wisdom not desperation You may also be noticing patterns and synchronicities that you cannot ignore repeating numbers timely conversations messages that seem to find you at the exact moment you need them These are not coincidences They are confirmations When you see these alignments especially during moments of doubt or decision it is heaven saying you are on the path Stay alert Do not obsess over the signs but do not dismiss them either They are markers not the destination Another powerful sign is sudden clarity Ideas begin to flow Solutions surface unexpectedly You may wake up with insight about a problem that has followed you for years These are not random thoughts These are instructions And this is where many chosen ones hesitate They wait for the idea to feel perfect before acting But the transfer does not move through perfection It moves through obedience Write the ideas down Take the small steps The path often reveals itself only after movement begins Chosen one I want you to hear this with your spirit not just your ears What you are experiencing right now is not chaos It is convergence Everything you have lived through the delays the disappointments the silent prayers are converging into this moment And in the next part I am going to show you why the chosen ones are the only ones trusted to carry this transfer and why your entire life has been preparing you for what is about to unfold Chosen one you must understand why this transfer is not random and why it is not falling into just any hands Heaven does not release weighty blessings without first shaping the vessel that will carry them And this is where your story begins to make sense The struggles you endured were not signs of being overlooked They were signs of being trained The delays were not denials They were divine recalibrations Everything that once confused you was quietly preparing you From the beginning you were different You noticed it early on Even if you could not name it you never fully blended in You questioned things others accepted blindly You felt deeply carried empathy and often bore responsibility that was heavier than your years While others moved through life untouched you were pressed refined and stretched That was not cruelty That was calling Wealth without character destroys but wealth with wisdom multiplies Heaven has been cultivating wisdom in you long before resources ever arrived Chosen one Many people want abundance but few can sustain it That is why so many rise quickly and fall just as fast But you have been built differently You learned endurance in seasons where nothing moved You learned discipline when you had to stretch little into enough You learned humility when recognition did not come You learned faith when logic failed These lessons were not optional They were required Because what is coming to you is not light It carries weight And weight demands strength I remember a season when I prayed for increase Yet everything around me seemed to shrink Opportunities disappeared Support faded At the time it felt like loss but later I realized something profound If the blessing had come then it would have crushed me My mind was not ready My boundaries were not strong enough My discernment was still developing Heaven withheld not to punish but to protect and chosen one The same was true for you This is why you are set apart You were not built to chase wealth blindly You were shaped to steward it Stewardship is not about how much you have It is about how you carry responsibility You have always felt the pull to do things with integrity even when cutting corners would have been easier You felt uneasy when something benefited you at the expense of others That sensitivity is not weakness It is qualification Heaven entrusts resources to those who can hold them without being consumed by them Chosen One another reason you are chosen is your awareness While many pursue money as an identity you understand that wealth is a tool You know that abundance without purpose feels empty You have seen people with everything still feel hollow That understanding did not come from books alone It came from observation from disappointment from realizing that fulfillment does not come from possession but from alignment This awareness sets you apart You are not meant to hoard You are meant to channel This is why you often feel called to help to uplift to contribute Even when you had little you gave Even when you were tired you showed up Even when no one noticed you stayed faithful That generosity of spirit is not accidental It is the reason wealth can flow through you without poisoning you Heaven does not release abundance into hands driven by ego It releases it into hands shaped by service Timing is another critical reason you are chosen You are stepping into a moment in history where old systems are breaking down You can see it everywhere Institutions once considered unshakable are trembling Economic structures are shifting What worked for generations no longer holds This is not chaos alone It is transition When old containers crack new ones are required And chosen one You are one of those new vessels The transfer is not merely financial It is spiritual It is a redistribution of influence opportunity and responsibility Resources are moving away from misuse and toward alignment That is why you were trained through scarcity Scarcity taught you value Lack taught you management Waiting taught you patience These lessons make you the right steward for what is coming Your vision also sets you apart While others see obstacles you see possibilities Where others stop you imagine alternatives This is not just creativity It is perception It is the ability to see beyond the surface into what could be Many of the ideas stirring inside you now are not random They are previews They are seeds They are glimpses of what you will soon be called to build support or lead chosen one Humility has been one of your greatest protections Even as you grow you remain teachable Even as you succeed you remain grounded You ask questions you listen you reflect Pride shuts doors Humility opens them This posture has preserved you It has kept your heart flexible and your spirit receptive And this is why favor follows you quietly Courage is another mark You have stepped forward when fear told you to retreat You have taken risks others avoided But your courage is not reckless It is rooted in trust You do not move blindly You move prayerfully You move thoughtfully You move with an inner assurance that you are guided even when the path is unclear This balance is rare and it is necessary for what lies ahead Chosen one Your calling is generational This transfer is not just about your comfort It is about legacy The decisions you will make the structures you will build the resources you will manage will echo beyond your lifetime That is why your preparation has been intense You are not being delayed You are being fortified And in the next part I will speak to you about the three forces that determine whether this transfer is merely received or fully sustained faith alignment and action Because what is coming to you must not only arrive it must endure Chosen one now we must speak plainly about what determines whether this great transfer merely visits your life or becomes established within it There are three forces that must move together in harmony for the promise to mature fully Faith alignment and action These are not abstract ideas They are living principles When one is missing the flow weakens When all three are active the transfer accelerates Let us begin with faith because faith is always the foundation Faith is not optimism and it is not denial Faith is the quiet confidence that remains steady when evidence is absent It is the ability to stand firm when nothing around you confirms what you know inside Many people think faith is loud declarations but true faith is often silent endurance It is waking up and continuing when you feel tired It is trusting timing when impatience presses in It is holding the vision even when others misunderstand you Chosen one You have already been walking by faith longer than you realize Every time you kept going without reassurance faith was active Every time you chose integrity over shortcuts faith was working Every time you believed there was more for you while circumstances said otherwise faith was shaping you This is why you survived seasons that would have broken others Faith sustained you when logic could not But hear this clearly Faith is not passive Faith prepares If you truly believe rain is coming you do not stand still You prepare the ground In the same way if you believe the transfer is approaching you prepare your inner world Faith changes how you speak It changes how you think It changes how you respond to pressure You stop speaking in defeat You stop rehearsing lack You stop making decisions rooted in fear Faith trains your mind to agree with what heaven has already decided Now let us speak about alignment because faith without alignment creates frustration Alignment is when your inner beliefs your daily habits and your spiritual posture move in the same direction Many people pray for abundance while living in contradiction They desire increase but hold on to scarcity thinking They ask for more but mishandle what they already have Alignment is the work of bringing everything into harmony Chosen one Alignment always begins internally You cannot attract expansion while your inner dialogue is still rehearsing limitation If you constantly tell yourself that wealth is for others that you always fall short that nothing ever works out for you you are resisting what you are asking for These beliefs act like invisible walls They do not stop heavens ability but they restrict your capacity to receive Replacing these beliefs is not shallow positivity It is spiritual realignment You are agreeing with truth instead of past wounds You are choosing to speak life where fear once lived When your words change your energy shifts When your energy shifts your decisions change And when your decisions change your reality begins to follow Alignment also shows up in how you handle responsibility If you are praying for increase but avoiding discipline something is out of order Stewardship is spiritual Managing time money and energy with care is not separate from prayer They are connected Heaven tests with small things before releasing larger ones If you are careless with little you will feel overwhelmed by much I have seen this repeatedly People receive sudden opportunities and lose them because they lacked structure But you chosen one have been trained differently You learned to plan when resources were limited You learned to be intentional when options were few Those habits matter now They are signs of alignment Timing is another part of alignment There is a divine season for every release When you try to force what is not ready you exhaust yourself When you wait beyond your moment you miss momentum Alignment teaches discernment It teaches you when to pause and when to move And when you are aligned you feel peace even in uncertainty because you trust that what is meant for you will not pass you by Now we come to action the most misunderstood pillar Action is where faith becomes visible You can believe deeply and be perfectly aligned but without movement nothing changes Action is the signal that tells heaven you are ready to participate in what has been promised Chosen one action does not always look dramatic Often it begins small Researching an idea making a phone call writing a plan learning a new skill These steps may feel insignificant but they are powerful The universe responds to movement Momentum is created when faith steps forward even before clarity is complete Many chosen ones delay action waiting for certainty They say they will move when fear disappears when resources increase when conditions improve but growth does not wait for comfort The perfect moment rarely arrives The path reveals itself as you walk it There is a principle that says faith without works is lifeless This does not mean striving It means responding When you act on what you know even imperfectly you activate flow Doors open after movement not before it Guidance becomes clearer once you step forward not while you remain still Obedience is a crucial part of action Sometimes you will be prompted to do things that do not make sense logically to give when it feels risky to leave something familiar to pursue an idea that feels too big These moments are not tests of intelligence They are tests of trust Obedience unlocks what logic cannot Chosen one These three forces are not separate paths They are one system Faith fuels alignment Alignment directs action Action strengthens faith When one weakens the whole flow slows But when all three are active the transfer accelerates naturally I want you to pause and reflect honestly Where is your faith strong but your action delayed Where is your action busy but your alignment of awareness is not condemnation It is invitation Begin where you are Strengthen what is weak Adjust what is misaligned Take one intentional step In the next part we will go deeper into the spiritual and practical path of receiving wealth Because what is coming to you must not only arrive it must be sustained Chosen one Now we must speak about the path itself because wealth does not arrive randomly and it does not remain without structure It flows along a path that is both spiritual and practical Many people lean heavily to one side and neglect the other Some are deeply spiritual but avoid responsibility discipline and planning Others are practical and ambitious but disconnected from inner guidance and higher purpose Both paths alone are incomplete What is coming to you requires balance Everything begins in the unseen Before wealth takes form in your hands it must take shape in your inner world Your thoughts beliefs and emotional patterns are not neutral They are creative forces You are constantly shaping your future by what you allow to live within you This is why the preparation you have been going through has been so internal Heaven was not only changing your circumstances it was reshaping your inner environment Chosen one Abundance begins with gratitude Not forced gratitude Not pretending everything is fine but real recognition of what has already carried you this far Gratitude shifts your posture from lack to expectancy I remember seasons where I had very little materially Yet the moment I began to genuinely honor what I did have clarity followed Not instantly but steadily Gratitude does not deny struggle It acknowledges provision within it And that acknowledgment opens the door for more Another spiritual practice that prepares you for wealth is vision You must be able to see yourself in the life you are being prepared for Not in fantasy but in felt reality Close your eyes and imagine stability Imagine freedom Imagine having enough to breathe to give to build Do not just see images Feel the peace Feel the security Feel the responsibility This emotional alignment matters When your nervous system becomes familiar with abundance you stop sabotaging it when it arrives Prayer and stillness are also essential Prayer aligns your desire with divine wisdom Stillness allows you to hear guidance that noise drowns out Many answers you are seeking will not come through effort alone They will come through listening I have seen some of the most important directions arrive in moments of quiet not urgency When you slow down internally clarity accelerates externally Chosen one giving is another spiritual law that cannot be bypassed You cannot receive freely if you refuse to release This does not mean reckless generosity It means intentional flow When you give with wisdom and an open heart you create circulation Stagnation breaks when flow begins Holding tightly out of fear sends a message of mistrust Giving from alignment sends a message of readiness Forgiveness is also part of the spiritual path Unforgiven wounds drain energy Resentment ties your future to your past I have watched people delay their own breakthroughs because they carried old bitterness like a shield not realizing it was a cage Forgiveness is not about excusing harm It is about reclaiming your power When you release what hurt you you free space for what is meant to bless you Now chosen one we must speak about the practical path because spiritual readiness alone is not enough Heaven does not pour abundance into chaos Preparation is proof of readiness Start with stewardship How you manage what you have now reveals how you will manage more Even if what you have feels small treat it with care Respect creates increase Budgeting planning tracking and intentional spending are not just financial tools They are spiritual disciplines They teach order They teach awareness They teach responsibility Many people pray for overflow while living without structure But structure is what holds overflow safely When you show that you can manage wisely capacity expands Education is another key Opportunities will come but knowledge determines whether you can sustain them Learn about money learn about business learn about investing and systems You do not need to master everything overnight but you must be willing to grow Sudden wealth without understanding often disappears quickly Preparation preserves what arrives Your skills also matter Wealth often flows through what you are called to do Identify what you are naturally good at Develop it Refine it Offer it with excellence When your work is aligned with your gifts provision follows more naturally This is not about hustling endlessly It is about working in alignment Relationships are part of the practical path as well The right connections open doors that effort alone cannot Be intentional about who you allow close Surround yourself with people who value growth integrity and purpose Relationships built on mutual respect and shared values become bridges for opportunity The universe often moves through people There will also be moments that require risk Calculated prayerful risk Growth demands movement beyond comfort You may be prompted to start something invest or shift direction Fear will speak loudly in these moments But fear is not a reliable guide Discernment is seek wisdom then move Remaining stagnant guarantees nothing changes Balance is the key chosen one Spiritual alignment without action creates waiting without manifestation Action without spiritual grounding creates exhaustion without fulfillment When you combine both flow begins You move with purpose instead of pressure You act with clarity instead of anxiety Persistence will be required The path is rarely linear There will be setbacks delays adjustments These are not signs of failure They are refinements Seeds do not sprout the day they are planted Trust the process Stay consistent Stay grounded Keep your motives clean Wealth is a tool not an identity If your focus becomes ego or comparison the flow weakens But when your intention remains service freedom and impact provision continues to increase Chosen one The steps you take now are shaping the container that will hold what is coming This is not about rushing It is about readiness Walk faithfully in the unseen Act wisely in the scene When both paths merge you become a stable vessel for abundance And in the next part I will speak to you about why now is the appointed time and why everything you are witnessing in the world and in your life confirms that this moment has arrived Chosen one Now we must speak about timing because timing is everything You may have asked yourself many times why now Why after all these years Why not earlier when I was struggling the most These are not wrong questions They are human questions and they deserve an honest grounded answer What you are stepping into is not delayed It is appointed And an appointed time does not arrive when it is convenient It arrives when alignment is complete Everything happening in your life right now is part of a larger design This message reaching you at this moment is not coincidence It is confirmation We are living in a season of transition Not only personally but globally Systems that once appeared stable are cracking Economic models institutions and structures that people relied on for security are shifting This is not simply chaos It is exposure What was built on imbalance cannot hold forever Chosen one The shaking you see in the world is the same shaking you once felt internally Before your life began to change something in you had to be unsettled Old beliefs were challenged Comfort zones collapsed Certainty faded At the time it felt destabilizing Now you can see it was preparation The same pattern is unfolding on a larger scale The old era is losing its grip and space is being made for something new There is a principle that says when what is misaligned is shaken only what is true remains That is what is happening now Resources are being repositioned Influence is shifting Opportunities are moving toward those who can carry them responsibly This is the environment where transfer occurs Not in comfort but in transition Chosen one Many spiritual teachings have spoken of a season when those who endured quietly would be elevated openly A time when what was stored up would be released suddenly This is not mythology It is pattern You may have heard the phrase that the wealth of the unjust is laid up for the righteous But that statement is not about morality alone It is about stewardship Resources move toward alignment Look at your own life Notice how things have been rearranging Relationships ended that once defined you Paths closed that you thought were permanent Directions shifted without warning These were not punishments They were repositionings You were being moved into place Like pieces on a board Every move was intentional You may not have seen the full picture but the strategist did I remember a time when multiple things fell apart at once Work relationships plans It felt like loss stacked on loss Only later did I realize that staying where I was would have limited what I was meant to carry next What felt like collapse was actually extraction I was being pulled out of something too small for what was ahead Chosen one You have lived through a similar extraction Another reason now is the appointed time is collective readiness Over the past few years something has shifted in human consciousness People are questioning systems that once went unchallenged They are seeking meaning beyond survival They are becoming aware that wealth without purpose leaves emptiness This awakening creates a different environment When consciousness rises new forms of abundance become possible This is why you may have noticed an increase in your own sensitivity Stronger intuition vivid dreams a deeper awareness of energy timing and alignment These are not random developments They are signs that the boundary between the unseen and the seen is thinner Now guidance is clearer Instruction is more direct Those who are listening receive advantage Acceleration is another marker of appointed time In earlier seasons progress was slow Effort yielded little Now movement happens faster Conversations lead to opportunities quickly Ideas gain traction sooner Decisions create momentum instead of resistance This is not coincidence It is compression Time feels faster because preparation is complete The seeds you planted years ago are reaching maturity Not just financial seeds but seeds of discipline integrity patience and resilience You sowed when nothing seemed to grow You remained faithful when no reward was visible That sewing did not disappear It was stored And now it is being released in concentrated form You may still wonder why the waiting lasted so long The answer is readiness If abundance had arrived before your inner world stabilized it would have magnified insecurity If influence had arrived before humility settled it would have amplified ego Timing protects both the blessing and the bearer Delay was not rejection It was refinement Chosen one There is also a global dimension to this moment Old economic systems built on exploitation are being exposed This exposure creates instability but it also creates opportunity New structures must be built New leaders must rise New stewards are required Those stewards are not chosen randomly They are chosen through endurance This is why you were trained in isolation Why you learned to stand alone Why you became selfaware instead of dependent on external validation While others chased shortcuts you learned principles While others relied on systems you learned adaptability These traits are essential Now you are being called not just to receive but to help build what comes next to invest wisely to create ethically to lead responsibly The wealth coming to you is not only personal provision it is building material and your past prepared you to handle it without losing yourself Favor is another confirmation of timing You may notice help arriving unexpectedly support showing up without request Doors opening with little effort This is not luck It is alignment When timing meets readiness resistance decreases Chosen one The appointed time is not approaching It has arrived The signs are everywhere In the world in your life in your spirit The restlessness you feel is not anxiety It is anticipation Something old has ended Something new is beginning In the next part we will speak about warnings and wisdom because what is entrusted must be protected Blessing requires vigilance and wisdom ensures what arrives remains Chosen one as this great transfer begins to move closer to your life it is essential that we speak not only about promise but about protection Blessings do not arrive without responsibility Increase demands awareness What is coming to you is valuable and anything of value must be guarded with wisdom This is not a message of fear It is a message of preparation so that what is released into your hands can remain there and multiply The first area that requires vigilance is your inner posture Wealth has a way of amplifying what already exists within a person If humility is rooted in you abundance will expand generosity clarity and purpose But if ego is left unchecked wealth will magnify pride impatience and recklessness This is why your character was refined before your resources increased You were trained through obscurity to remain grounded Do not abandon that posture now Ego is subtle It rarely announces itself It whispers instead It tells you that you no longer need counsel that you earned everything alone that correction is unnecessary These thoughts are dangerous because they separate you from guidance Everything flowing to you has a source beyond your effort Remembering that truth keeps you aligned Gratitude protects you Humility preserves you Discernment is the next safeguard As your life expands so will your visibility As resources increase so will attention Not every opportunity presented to you will be aligned with your purpose Not every person who approaches you will have clean motives Some will be drawn to what you carry not who you are This is not cynicism It is realism Chosen one learn to pause before deciding Learn to sit with an offer instead of rushing into it Discernment grows in stillness When something feels pressured urgent or emotionally manipulative step back True alignment does not demand haste It brings peace even when it stretches you Your intuition will sharpen as you continue to practice stillness and reflection Trust it Boundaries are another essential form of wisdom Your heart is generous by nature You feel called to help to give to uplift This is beautiful But generosity without boundaries becomes depletion Not everyone is ready to receive what you offer Giving to those who refuse responsibility can drain your energy and derail your assignment Empowerment and enabling are not the same Wisdom knows the difference Protect your time as carefully as you protect your money Energy is currency Attention is currency Where you invest them determines what grows You are not required to be available to everyone You are responsible for stewarding yourself well Rest is not laziness Privacy is not selfishness Boundaries are not rejection They are preservation Stewardship must also be addressed clearly What is coming to you is more than finances It is influence responsibility and reach Without systems even the greatest blessing can slip away Learn to plan Learn to organize Learn to seek wise counsel This does not mean outsourcing your authority It means honoring wisdom Surround yourself with advisers who align with your values not just your ambition Comparison is another quiet threat In a world saturated with curated success it is easy to measure your journey against others But your assignment is unique Your timing is specific The form your blessing takes will not mirror anyone elses Comparison creates pressure that leads to poor decisions Stay in your lane Focus on your path When you honor your own process growth remains steady Fear disguised as caution is another trap As you expand voices will rise some external some internal warning you to play small While wisdom encourages discernment fear encourages retreat Learn to distinguish between the two Wisdom invites evaluation then movement Fear invites delay hesitation and shrinking You were not prepared to hide You were prepared to lead Maintaining spiritual practices becomes even more important as success increases When life becomes busy it is tempting to abandon what once grounded you Prayer reflection journaling gratitude These are not optional habits They are anchors Many lose clarity after their breakthrough because they stopped doing what kept them aligned Do not make that mistake Stay rooted as you rise Privacy is also wisdom Not every plan needs to be announced Not every victory needs to be shared Noise invites interference Move quietly when necessary Let results speak This is not secrecy born of fear but strategy born of maturity Security often grows in silence Legacy thinking is another essential lens for this season The wealth being transferred to you is not only for immediate enjoyment It is for sustainability for family for community for impact beyond your lifetime Ask yourself not just what you can gain but what you can build This mindset transforms decisions It shifts focus from consumption to cultivation Never lose sight of purpose Wealth is a tool not an identity It does not define you It amplifies you If your focus remains service impact and alignment the flow will continue If purpose is lost stagnation follows Regularly ask yourself whether your choices align with your calling This question keeps you centered Chosen one you have endured too much to be careless Now this season requires balance Authority with humility boldness with discernment generosity with wisdom When these are held together protection is established around your blessing The warnings shared here are not restrictions They are safeguards They exist to ensure that what arrives does not depart prematurely You are not only meant to receive You are meant to sustain grow and multiply And in the next and final part we will bring this journey to completion anchoring everything you have received into a clear closing and call forward so you can step fully into what has been prepared for you Chosen one You have walked through this message for a reason If you are still here it is because something within you recognizes truth when it is spoken This was not entertainment This was alignment Every word you have heard has been stirring what was already placed inside you long before this moment And now we come to the closing not as an ending but as a commissioning You now understand why your life unfolded the way it did The struggle was not meaningless The delays were not accidental The isolation was not rejection Everything you endured shaped your capacity refined your discernment and strengthened your spirit You were not being punished You were being prepared And preparation always precedes release Look at how far you have come There were seasons when you did not think you would make it through Moments when doubt whispered louder than hope Times when you questioned your worth your direction even your faith Yet here you are still standing still seeking still open That persistence was not random It positioned you Chosen one The great transfer of wealth is not just an external event It is an internal shift that expresses itself outwardly You are stepping into a season where provision meets purpose where resources meet responsibility where increase meets integrity This is not about sudden riches without structure It is about sustained abundance backed by wisdom This wealth is coming to you because heaven trusts you Trust is not given lightly It is earned through faithfulness in unseen seasons Through obedience when no one was watching through humility when recognition did not come through discipline when shortcuts were available You proved yourself ready long before you realized it Now hear this clearly What is coming to you will require your participation Blessing does not override choice Alignment must be maintained Faith must be practiced Action must continue The flow responds to movement Do not retreat into fear as things begin to change Change is confirmation not threat You may feel moments of uncertainty as your life expands That is natural Growth stretches capacity But remember this you are not stepping into something unfamiliar You are stepping into what you were trained for Every lesson you learned will now serve you Every boundary you developed will protect you Every insight you gained will guide you Chosen one This season will ask you to rise in ways you have never had to before To make decisions that carry weight to lead with clarity to steward with wisdom But you will not be doing this alone Guidance will continue to come Doors will continue to open Support will appear when needed Stay attentive Stay grounded Remember the balance Stay humble as you rise Stay disciplined as resources increase Stay spiritually connected as life becomes busier Stay generous but wise Stay bold but discerning This balance is your strength It will keep you steady while everything around you expands This wealth is not only for your comfort It is for impact for freedom for building something that lasts for uplifting others for creating opportunities where there were none for breaking cycles that have limited generations You are not just receiving for yourself You are carrying something forward There will be moments when you are tempted to look back to doubt to question whether you are truly ready When those moments come return to what you know You survived what was meant to break you You learned what others avoided You endured what refined you That did not happen by chance chosen one The season you are entering will reveal who is aligned to walk with you and who must remain behind Let this happen without resentment without guilt without fear What is leaving is making room What is arriving is aligned Trust the rearrangement As you move forward continue to listen Continue to grow Continue to act Small steps taken consistently create massive shifts over time Do not underestimate obedience in ordinary moments Many breakthroughs are born there I want you to take a moment now wherever you are and breathe deeply Let the weight of this message settle Let gratitude rise for what has been and expectancy rise for what is coming You do not need to rush You do not need to strive You simply need to stay aligned and responsive Chosen one this is your time Not because you are perfect but because you are prepared not because you are better than others but because you were willing to be shaped The great transfer of wealth is not approaching It is already unfolding around you Stand tall Walk forward Carry what has been entrusted to you with wisdom courage and grace You are not late You are not behind You are exactly where you need to be The only thing left now is for you to step into it fully without fear Chosen one Take a moment and let your spirit settle into what has just been released This is not the end of a message This is the ceiling of an appointment What heaven has spoken over you is already in motion And nothing meant for you can miss you in this hour You are standing in your chyros moment the exact time ordained for your elevation your alignment and your increase Anointed one the great transfer of wealth is not a burden It is a sacred trust And you have been chosen because your heart has been refined Your faith has been tested and your spirit has remained teachable Remain discerning Guard your space Stay anchored in the practices that kept you steady when the ground was shaking Do not allow the noise of the world to pull you out of alignment with what heaven is doing through you I declare peace over your mind clarity over your decisions and favor over every step ahead What was delayed is now accelerating What was hidden is now coming into view Walk forward with gratitude knowing the divine has already gone before you and prepared the way If this word resonated with your spirit you may mark this moment with a simple declaration below or quietly share it with another chosen soul who needs confirmation Stay faithful stay aligned and rise without fear This is your "

        "plain_text": "Hello Hello All right Welcome So what we wanted to share right now is actually maybe more personal I wanted to share something with you and and that is that we when I say we I dont mean to sound weird but it is how weve come to understand this human body because we have come to to comprehend this human body much different than what most people think And this whole system is is very different than what most people think too And so they havent fully learned how it is to truly truly operate their human being correctly And when we say correctly what we mean is not some egoic uh snobbery or something like that but its more to do with being an energetically being in an an energet energetic correct frequency within your own system And thats not something that many beings are operating in We are operating like that more and more now We are sort of messing up less and less and we are starting to function quite well in that way too and not just think that were crazy type of thing But the to have multiple sensory experiences where you you know that you have access to different consciousness That is actually a quite a big thing to realize and we believe that most beings are and have capability of that and that can be trained In fact that is what we are we are training people to get there There is a link in the bio if youre interested in that And so that training is taking you and changing your consciousness in order to think more like an ascended master is what we were saying But it is to think in close vicinity to energetic truth That is the main uh part of this message is this energetic truth because that is how you are connecting to the and and what what is energetic truth It is the truth of energy and its the truth of the body Most beings are going around pretending fantasy realities between maybe even large groups of people so it seems real right Thats what you get in cities You get people behaving in a certain way and in certain sort of communities you get people behaving in a certain way or countries right And so when you are operating and these teachings go against uh not against um these go by the way what were doing here we are channeling we are channeling higher intelligence but were also making sense of it with you and for you so that you can comprehend your own energy because your own energy is the most precious that you have It is your commodity really is your energy in essence And thats something to realize and to really get on a subtomic particle level so that youre truly ingraining that into your body And we have a lot of hair remedies for that And thats also linked in the bio in the description And those are more vibratory They are working on the vibratory field Some of these corrections are working on the mind aspect to correct certain things that then become in alignment with energetic truth and certain things The HYA sessions they the HYA remedies sorry they they were called sessions before but now theyre called HA remedies They are remedies frequency remedies ch channelneled frequency remedies for the body for the human electromag magnetic field for certain situations and certain energy corrections and those can be frequency attuned as well And that is something that you can get from these HYA remedies And you once you if your intuition is in tuned you can go on the store and you can sort of feel for what is actually calling you and you will notice certain ones will light up for you That is Gaia Gaia speaks to you like that in order to figure out what you actually need and what your body need to calibrate right now to this holistic perspective And so the energetic truth once you are connecting the once you are seeing the world correctly with the energetic truth and that youre correcting your perspective to be in sync with your own body By the way its not something that we say but with your own body Once you are in sync with your own body then your body you will start to have a really deep connection with your body a much deeper connection that you might realize because what many beings are doing is that theyre usually projecting onto other beings But once you get really good at this consciousness shifting game you will start to retract a lot of these projections that you have given other things and other beings so that you start to become selfcontained energy and so that your energy is for you to birth creations If thats what you want that is something that you can do now And so once you if you want lets say your intuitive abilities it is a requirement you need to change these energies so that you are selfcontained You have to do that because unless you do that you are not connecting the right energies for that alignment of frequency calibration and your inunement to flow properly You see So it needs that correction in order for the energy to flow properly through the body Thats really all there is to it The mind may seem like it is complex It is not complex But the mind needs to sort of some minds needs to be sort of retrained We have had to go a complete retraining in order to think in the correct way sort of And were saying correct because were saying it needs to be in sync with your body Its not something that we say Its not something that you need to adhere to Its for your own benefit Because once you align with your own body and you properly sync up and you manage to get all of these energies right you light up like a battery And when you get to heal past all of these projections that you have comingled yourself with other beings and you fully take everything back you are like a selfcontaining organism and you get to have your energy at your disposal And only then can you truly start your life because then you will have your energy for you And then you get to do your life which is when your life gets exciting because you are making your life a reality Your dream life Thats what its about Thats when everything start to happen When you start to feel joy again When your life starts to blossom again When all of these energies just light up your whole human energy field and you are fully selfcontaining organism fully connected to the cosmos and fully rooted to Gaia in full harmony between the two That is what were inviting you for here We love you so much and we want to say thank you so much for being here Let us know in the comments how are you in frequency Where are you Where are you getting stuck Where is your I cant seem to get past this thing Let us know and we can help you We love you so much and well talk to you again in the next one Ciao Ciao for now "

        "plain_text": "Welcome the anointed ones The deepest betrayal doesnt kick down your door It already has a key knows where you hide things and still smiles at you during family photos Let that sit for a second because what youre about to hear isnt some exaggerated tale or dramatic rumor Its a pattern a real one Psychologists have long noted that the most damaging betrayals statistically come from people within the immediate family circle Not enemies not strangers not outsiders Why Because access beats aggression every time You dont need power when you have proximity You dont need force when you have trust And you definitely dont need to shout when youre already inside the house This is the part that makes people uncomfortable So expect a few nervous laughs the kind people do when the truth walks into the room uninvited and sits down like it pays rent Everyone loves the idea of loyalty Until the story points inward until the finger doesnt point at them but at one of ours Thats when the air changes Thats when denial clocks out early What shocked the town wasnt that something ugly happened towns have seen ugly before What shook them was realizing the damage didnt come from the outside It came from someone who shared meals memories and last names Someone who knew which buttons to push because they helped install them Someone who didnt trip into betrayal They navigated it like a shortcut theyd been mapping for years And heres the uncomfortable comedy in all of it People can accept a villain in a hoodie way faster than a villain in a family group chat The moment the truth surfaced you could almost hear the collective Wait them That pause right there Thats shock colliding with reality Thats the moment when disgust replaces confusion because now the story cant be blamed on bad luck misunderstandings or spiritual attacks from nowhere This isnt about drama Its about exposure Its about how being chosen doesnt just attract attention It reveals character especially in the people closest to you especially in the ones who watched you grow and quietly resented that you didnt shrink to make them comfortable So if you felt the room go quiet when the truth came out if you noticed how fast sides shifted and stories cracked good That silence wasnt awkwardness It was realization catching up to everyone at once Number one the betrayal didnt come from hatred It came from proximity What makes this kind of betrayal hit differently is that it wasnt fueled by rage or open hostility It was fueled by closeness Hatred is loud It announces itself You can see it coming Proximity is quiet It sits next to you at the table It knows your routines your moods your soft spots Thats why this kind of betrayal doesnt feel like an attack It feels like the floor giving way under your feet A sibling doesnt need to guess who you are Theyve already watched you become it Theyve seen you when you were unsure when you were hopeful when you were trying and failing and trying again That kind of access creates an advantage most people never have They know what hurts you because they were there when it first hurt They know what motivates you because theyve heard you talk when you thought you were safe Nothing had to be forced Everything was already within reach This wasnt about anger boiling over It was about familiarity being misused When someone that close turns against you they dont have to exaggerate much A small twist of truth sounds believable because it comes wrapped in shared history People trust it without realizing why Not because the story is solid but because the source feels familiar Thats why the damage goes so deep You dont just lose trust in that person You start questioning your own judgment You replay moments You wonder how long it was happening You ask yourself what else was real Proximity turns betrayal into selfdoubt And thats the part that takes time to undo The hardest truth is this The betrayal wasnt spontaneous It grew slowly in a place where trust lived It was built on listening observing and waiting Not because they hated you but because they knew you well enough to know when to move And that realization hurts more than any enemy ever could Because it didnt come from across the street It came from across the room Number two your sibling didnt want your life They wanted your position This kind of betrayal isnt about wanting what you have Its deeper more insidious Its about wanting the space you occupy the attention you attract the respect people give without question Your sibling didnt care about your struggles your dreams or even your accomplishments What they craved was the perception of power and influence that came naturally to you They wanted to stand where you stood be seen the way you were seen and feel the recognition that was never theirs When people witness this they often mistake it for jealousy over material things But it isnt that simple Its about replacement They werent just competing with you They were trying to occupy your identity in the eyes of others Every smile you earned every compliment every quiet nod of respect became a mark of what they felt they were missing They didnt need to destroy you outright They needed to shift perception so that the world would start noticing them instead of you Thats why proximity mattered They didnt have to invent influence They just had to redirect it This kind of betrayal feels personal because it hits at the core of your being People can accept competition from outsiders even enemies But when someone who knows the blueprint of your life tries to step into it it feels like the world itself is mocking you Every success you earned now becomes evidence of what they cant have and every interaction they twist becomes a weapon What makes it even more shocking to the town is how deliberate it often is This wasnt a rash decision or a moment of weakness Its a strategy developed over time under the radar until the moment when exposure couldnt be avoided Your sibling waited until your position was undeniable until your presence was commanding and then tried to insert themselves into that space The cruel irony is that their focus on replacing you exposes their own insecurity Theyre not attacking you because theyre strong Theyre attacking you because they feel small And that realization when people finally see it is what turns shock into disgust The fact that someone so close could calculate manipulate and coveret your position without anyone noticing is what keeps the story lingering in everyones mind long after the reveal Number three the town is disgusted because they see intent now not accidents What turns shock into disgust isnt just the act itself Its the realization that it was intentional People can forgive mistakes They can shrug off bad timing misunderstandings or coincidences But when the truth reveals deliberate planning calculated moves and cold awareness everything changes The moment the town understood that your siblings actions werent random that they had been observing waiting and striking with precision the reaction shifted Its one thing to fall victim to chance but its another to fall victim to someone who knew exactly what they were doing and did it anyway Intent has a weight that accidents dont Accidents are forgivable because they carry uncertainty Intent carries responsibility Its a mark of consciousness of knowing the difference between right and wrong and choosing the path that causes harm Anyway when people realized your sibling acted with full awareness their perception of you changed Yes But more importantly their perception of them changed Shock transformed into moral outrage What was once dismissed as sibling rivalry or playful tension suddenly became something darker more deliberate and far more unsettling The disgust isnt just toward the betrayal itself Its toward the audacity it took to plan hide and execute it while presenting a mask of normaly The town saw the calm collected exterior that belied the manipulation beneath and that contrast is what made the revelation so jarring People instinctively recoil when they encounter calculated deceit from someone they thought they knew someone who shared the same bloodline and the same household This kind of betrayal leaves a lasting impression because it forces everyone to recalibrate their understanding of loyalty and family Accidents are fleeting Intent lingers It reshapes relationships shakes communities and etches memories that cant be unlearned The moment the town saw your siblings full awareness the deliberate choice to harm you for personal gain everything changed Thats why the shock was immediate and the disgust so deep Its a bitter recognition that harm doesnt always come from force or hate Sometimes it comes quietly knowingly from the people closest to you Number four your sibling knew exactly when to strike because they tracked your growth This betrayal wasnt impulsive It wasnt a random explosion of anger or jealousy It was timed with precision and the reason it landed so hard is that your sibling had been observing you all along They watched you evolve adapt and claimed spaces that were always meant for you They tracked not just what you were doing but who you were becoming They knew the exact moment when your influence your confidence and your presence could no longer be ignored And that was the moment they decided to act People often underestimate how methodical this kind of betrayal is Its not about immediate gratification Its about calculated impact They didnt strike when you were vulnerable or small They waited until you were undeniable until your trajectory was clear until your growth had made you a figure in the eyes of others Thats the cruel genius of it Striking at your peak amplifies the shock because its impossible to dismiss You werent just attacked The timing made it undeniable inescapable and public What makes this especially piercing is that the awareness behind it reveals something far darker than mere rivalry They werent acting out of a moment of weakness or accidental frustration They studied you tracked your habits and waited for the perfect alignment of circumstances Your successes werent just milestones for you They were signals for them markers of opportunity Thats why when the truth came out the town couldnt just shake it off as a mistake It was intentional deliberate and horrifyingly strategic And the reality of this tracking exposes a level of intimacy most people never experience They knew your rhythm your routines your vulnerabilities and they used that knowledge as a weapon Its a betrayal that feels almost impossible to process because its built on trust that had been silently accumulated over years They werent outsiders They werent enemies They were close enough to see your growth from the inside and they chose to turn it against you at the moment it would hurt the most That awareness that timing is what makes the shock linger and the disgust in the town so palpable Number five they weaponized familiarity to make the lie believable What makes this kind of betrayal so devastating isnt just the act itself but the fact that it came from someone who was trusted implicitly Familiarity is powerful People instinctively lower their defenses around those they know those who share their blood or their daily life Your sibling didnt need to shout threaten or manipulate wildly They already had the perfect camouflage shared history shared memories shared trust and they used it like a weapon Every word every gesture every story was designed to feel credible because it came from someone people assumed would never deceive them The brilliance and cruelty of it lies in the subtlety A stranger lying to you has to be convincing has to fabricate evidence has to overcompensate A familiar person doesnt Their actions are trusted almost automatically So the deception slides under the radar Thats why the towns reaction was so intense when the truth came out They realized how easily people can be manipulated when familiarity is exploited They realized that trust can be weaponized and that someone so close could twist perception without anyone suspecting a thing This betrayal is different because it forces people to reexamine their instincts The lies were not only believable they were comfortable They felt natural And that makes the eventual exposure sting even more because its not just the deception that shocks Its the realization that peoples own trust was used against them Its a hard lingering truth The closer someone is to you the more efficiently they can hurt you without leaving obvious scars Familiarity gave them the advantage and they exploited it fully Every interaction every casual conversation every piece of shared history became a tool to strengthen the lie When the town saw it unravel the disgust wasnt just toward the betrayal It was toward the ease with which the truth had been hidden in plain sight Thats why proximity combined with intention is so dangerous It doesnt just harm the individual It shakes the entire perception of loyalty trust and what people thought they knew about family Number six your siblings silence wasnt loyalty It was data collection Silence can feel like patience restraint or even respect People assume that when someone doesnt speak up theyre neutral harmless or loyal That assumption is exactly what your sibling relied on Their quiet wasnt about holding back or being careful It was about watching observing and gathering every bit of information they could use Every conversation you had every reaction you showed every strength and vulnerability you revealed was being logged mentally cataloged and analyzed That silence wasnt empty It was full of strategy The most chilling part is that data collection by someone close is nearly invisible Outsiders need to guess make moves and risk being seen Your sibling didnt have to guess They were inside your world moving in plain sight while you were completely unaware Every routine you followed every trust you extended every pattern in your behavior became a blueprint for them to exploit Thats why the eventual betrayal lands so hard The groundwork was already laid quietly over time without anyone noticing People often interpret quiet family members as wise or patient But in this case silence was a tool It gave them cover while they studied you It allowed them to see how you handled conflict how you celebrated victories how you trusted others and where you were soft By the time action was taken it didnt feel random It felt inevitable And that inevitability is what makes the towns reaction so intense They werent just shocked by the act itself They were horrified by how methodical it had been This kind of betrayal teaches a difficult lesson about trust Silence from someone close isnt always golden Sometimes its surveillance Sometimes its strategy Your siblings quiet was never about protecting you or the family It was about understanding you well enough to know exactly when where and how to strike And when the truth finally surfaced that realization how easily someone had weaponized observation made the betrayal feel unavoidable leaving everyone not just shocked but deeply unsettled by the level of calculated patience involved Number seven the disgust comes from realizing they benefited while you suffered The moment people truly feel the weight of betrayal isnt when harm is done Its when they see the perpetrator gain from it Your sibling didnt just hurt you They profited from it in ways that were obvious once the truth came to light They didnt stumble into advantage They stepped in deliberately taking what they could while leaving you to carry the cost That imbalance is what makes the reaction so intense People can forgive pain if its mutual if its shared or if its accidental But when one person thrives on the suffering of another disgust rises because fairness integrity and basic decency are thrown out the window Watching someone you trusted benefit while you struggled strikes a nerve that goes deeper than anger Its a betrayal of fundamental expectations You expect family to protect support and at the very least not exploit your weaknesses Seeing your sibling climb gain approval or bask in the attention that should have been shared or rightfully yours turns that shock into moral outrage The town isnt just witnessing an act of betrayal Theyre witnessing the exploitation of trust And human brains are wired to react strongly to injustice especially when it comes from someone so close What makes it worse is that this kind of gain is often hidden until the very end making the revelation even more shocking The town may have seen small advantages subtle manipulations or moments where your siblings seemed lucky but the pattern only becomes undeniable when the full scope is revealed Thats when the disgust hits hardest because people realize that suffering wasnt a byproduct It was a tool for someone elses benefit This kind of revelation doesnt just reflect poorly on the sibling It reframes the entire narrative of your life from their perspective It forces everyone to see how carefully they orchestrated moments to serve themselves how calculated their moves were and how long they were willing to let you endure hardship while smiling pretending or maintaining a facade of normaly That realization is bitter slow burning and unforgettable because its one thing to be hurt but its another to know someone gained from your pain without shame Number eight your strength exposed their dependency on manipulation The hardest truth about betrayals from someone close is that they reveal as much about the betrayer as they do about the victim Your sibling relied on manipulation to feel in control because they couldnt match your strength naturally Every subtle twist every lie every halftruth was an attempt to bend reality to their favor They werent prepared for your resilience Your ability to keep moving forward to maintain composure and to rise above the schemes left them exposed Their whole strategy depended on you faltering on you reacting predictably on you breaking in ways they could exploit But your strength made their manipulation useless Strength has a way of laying bare the weakness of those who try to use others as tools They counted on patterns on predictable reactions on fear or confusion But as you stood firm their control unraveled Thats why this kind of betrayal is so shocking to others Its not just the act itself Its the revelation that the person orchestrating it couldnt succeed without your cooperation Even if your cooperation was unspoken your presence your confidence your unwillingness to bend fully to their narrative exposed the fragility of their power When the town saw the aftermath part of their shock and disgust wasnt just about the betrayal It was about the failure Your sibling had built their entire strategy around influence and manipulation Yet your strength calmness and clarity left them exposed as desperate insecure and dependent on deceit That dependency is humiliating to witness because it flips the script The aggressor the one who seemed cunning and in control now appears weak desperate and petty in comparison This exposure isnt immediate It seeps in People start to notice patterns they previously ignored They see how much effort was required to maintain the illusion of control and how fragile that control was in the face of your unwavering presence Your strength didnt just protect you It revealed the truth about them It showed the town that manipulation is only as powerful as the person willing to fall for it And you standing tall and unaffected proved that some strengths arent just survival They are unmasking forces in themselves Number nine the town saw how quickly they switched masks when exposed The real shock in this story isnt just that the betrayal happened Its how easily your sibling changed faces the moment the truth came to light For months maybe even years they wore a mask that made them seem harmless supportive or even loyal That mask built trust lulled everyone into a sense of security and created the perfect cover for their actions But the moment exposure hit the mask didnt just slip it shattered And what the town saw underneath was startling They werent just guilty They were theatrical defensive and almost performative in how they tried to rewrite the narrative to protect themselves Switching masks so quickly is a sign of someone who relies on appearances rather than substance They didnt expect their true intentions to be visible And when the world finally saw the truth panic set in Suddenly the calm familiar face everyone trusted became a mask of urgency manipulation and even desperation Thats what made the betrayal so unsettling for onlookers The mask had been believable for so long precisely because it was consistent and the sudden change made the deceit undeniable Its one thing to lie quietly but its another to scramble under the pressure of accountability and reveal the depth of planning that had been happening behind the scenes The speed at which they switched faces also amplified the disgust People dont just recoil from the betrayal itself They recoil from the duplicity the ease with which someone you know can act like a completely different person depending on whos watching That duality exposes the manipulators reliance on perception over reality showing the town that everything they thought they knew about this person was carefully curated This kind of revelation leaves a lasting impact because it forces people to reassess every interaction every smile every word that seemed genuine in the past The mask didnt just hide their intentions It shaped the reality of those around them When the mask came off the truth hit with a force that left no room for doubt Your siblings ability to switch faces so quickly didnt just expose their guilt It exposed the fragility of trust the ease of manipulation and the harsh reality that some people can live double lives without anyone noticing until they are caught Number 10 This wasnt rivalry It was identity theft at a spiritual level What makes this kind of betrayal so devastating isnt the rivalry Its the attempt to replace you entirely Your sibling didnt just want to compete They wanted to step into your life your energy and your influence as if it were theirs to claim This goes beyond ordinary jealousy or sibling conflict Its a theft of identity subtle yet profound Every habit they mimicked every opinion they echoed every space they tried to occupy wasnt random It was calculated to make others see them as you while diminishing your presence People often dismiss this type of behavior because it doesnt look violent or aggressive on the surface But identity theft at a spiritual level is insidious because it erodess your sense of self while creating a convincing illusion for everyone else They werent trying to overshadow you with force They were trying to become you to occupy the essence of what makes you recognizable admirable or influential Thats why the towns reaction was so intense They werent just witnessing betrayal They were seeing someone attempt to erase your uniqueness and insert themselves in its place The cruelty in this is intentional It requires patience observation and strategy They watched how people responded to you learned which parts of your character drew respect admiration or fear and then subtly inserted themselves in those same spaces Its an attack on identity because it aims to confuse perception When someone mimics your energy and accomplishments it blurs the lines between authenticity and imitation Suddenly people start questioning what was yours to begin with And yet the very attempt to steal your identity exposes their insecurity They couldnt create influence on their own They couldnt command respect naturally They needed you as a blueprint a reference point Thats why your resilience becomes so critical It not only protects you but it unmasks them Every person watching realizes the difference between genuine growth and calculated imitation This is why the betrayal feels so personal and so corrosive Its not about competition Its about someone trying to live as you while hoping no one notices the theft The moment the truth comes out its not just a shock Its a revelation that some people will go to extreme lengths to claim the life presence and identity that doesnt belong to them Number 11 Your refusal to retaliate forced the truth to stand on its own Theres a power in restraint that many people underestimate When betrayal hits the instinct is to fight back to expose to defend yourself loudly But in this case your refusal to react the way your sibling expected became a force more powerful than any words or confrontation By staying composed by refusing to engage in theatrics you allowed the truth to reveal itself fully Lies and manipulation thrive on reaction They depend on chaos fear or confusion to stay hidden When you didnt provide that fuel everything your sibling had built began to collapse under its own weight Your restraint didnt look like power at first To some it may have even seemed passive like nothing was happening but in reality it was strategic By not retaliating you forced the world and the town to pay attention to the facts not the noise Every inconsistency every twisted story every hidden agenda became visible because there was no distraction no argument no drama to obscure it The truth could finally stand alone unmasked undeniable and undeniable in its impact What makes this so shocking to people is that theyve rarely seen this level of control in the face of betrayal Most reactions add layers of emotion that obscure reality But when someone refuses to react it forces the betrayer into the spotlight Your sibling who counted on chaos to hide their intentions suddenly became exposed Their lies manipulation and calculated moves were now undeniable because there was no counternarrative coming from you This type of response also rewrites the perception of power People assume power comes from confrontation from forceful action But here the power was quiet measured and deliberate It allowed justice to unfold naturally without interference without overexposure Your composure became a mirror reflecting the truth in its roarest form It didnt just protect you It revealed your sibling for who they really were Thats why the towns reaction wasnt just shock or anger It was a slow dawning realization that sometimes the strongest response is no response at all Letting reality carry the weight of revelation while the betrayer crumbles under the truth Number 12 The exposure shattered a generational illusion Betrayal like this doesnt just reveal the actions of one person It exposes the patterns that have been quietly tolerated for years Families survive on unspoken rules invisible hierarchies and agreements to look the other way We dont talk about it We protect our own no matter what These silent codes create the illusion of loyalty trust and unity But when your siblings betrayal came to light it didnt just expose them It tore through the entire framework that allowed their actions to go unnoticed The town saw more than a single act of deception They saw a system of concealment that had been operating quietly for generations The shock comes from realizing how normalized certain behaviors had become People begin to question every interaction every story every tradition What had been dismissed as harmless sibling rivalry minor disagreements or private family drama suddenly takes on a darker meaning The betrayal isnt isolated Its symptomatic It exposes how family dynamics can create conditions where manipulation envy and exploitation are possible and even quietly enabled And when the town sees that the reaction isnt just disbelief Its disgust because suddenly they realize this wasnt about you It was about the culture that allowed someone to get away with harming the person closest to them What makes this revelation even more powerful is its ripple effect Once the illusion cracks it doesnt just affect you and your sibling It reaches everyone who had been complicit knowingly or unknowingly relatives neighbors friends and onlookers are forced to reassess what they thought was normal what they considered acceptable and what they allowed to persist It forces a confrontation with uncomfortable truths about loyalty morality and accountability within families and communities The exposure is brutal but necessary It removes the mask that generations have worn showing that betrayal is rarely spontaneous It is cultivated in silence hidden beneath appearances and permitted by tradition The towns shock and disgust are understandable because they are witnessing not just one persons moral failure but the unraveling of an entire illusion that had been maintained for years The betrayal becomes a lens through which everyone is forced to examine the structures that allowed it and the lesson lingers long after the initial shock fades Number 13 Theyre disgusted because they recognize the same trait in themselves The reaction of the town wasnt just shock or disbelief It carried a subtle unsettling layer of selfrecognition People dont recoil from betrayal solely because of what was done They recoil because they see reflections of themselves in the actions they condemn Your siblings choices cunning and willingness to harm someone close forced others to confront uncomfortable truths about their own capacity for envy manipulation or selfishness That mirror effect is what makes the disgust so profound Its no longer just about one persons moral failure Its about realizing that anyone under certain pressures or desires might act the same way This selfrecognition amplifies the intensity of the reaction People often prefer to see wrongdoing as external as something that exists over there or out there somewhere removed from themselves But when the perpetrator is family and the behavior is familiar the line blurs The town saw someone they knew who shared the same environment the same cultural norms and even the same upbringing commit acts they might have secretly imagined or rationalized in themselves That proximity makes the reflection unavoidable The disgust is part moral judgment part fear of latent tendencies within The recognition also forces people to reassess their own choices and past behavior They begin to replay moments where they might have acted selfishly where small manipulations or quiet envy shaped their interactions Suddenly they are not just observers of betrayal They are participants in a moral reckoning forced to question what separates them from someone who crossed the line That realization stings more than the act itself because it challenges their selfimage and forces introspection that most people resist This is why the towns reaction lingers long after the revelation It isnt just about judging your sibling Its about confronting a universal truth Under certain circumstances anyone can choose selfinterest over loyalty That recognition is uncomfortable even terrifying because it exposes vulnerability in everyone who witnesses it The disgust isnt just moral Its personal A mirror held up to the parts of themselves they rarely allow anyone to see The betrayal becomes more than a story It becomes a lesson in human nature reflection and the uncomfortable closeness between empathy envy and moral failure Number 14 This wasnt the end of your story It was the point of separation The most profound moment in a betrayal like this isnt when the truth comes out Its when the aftermath forces a realignment of everything you thought was permanent The betrayal didnt mark your downfall It marked the line between who belongs in your life and who doesnt It drew a clear boundary separating the people who were aligned with your growth from those who wanted to ride your success manipulate your influence or diminish your presence This is the point where clarity emerges where illusions crumble and where the roles people play in your life are revealed in their roarest form Separation isnt always easy especially when it involves family Society teaches us that blood ties are unbreakable that loyalty should be automatic and that enduring hardship with family is virtuous But when someone close betrays you their actions create a natural exit point They show with undeniable evidence that they cannot and will not coexist with the truth of your rise The town watching sees it too The shock the disgust the whispered recognition that some bonds arent sacred Theyre transactional conditional and ultimately replaceable This moment of separation is both painful and liberating painful because it forces confrontation with loss trust broken and shared history tainted Liberating because it clears space for authenticity growth and alignment with people who genuinely support you Its the point where you stop fighting for approval that will never come and start reclaiming the energy that was spent on managing manipulation The betrayal in essence becomes a filter separating your allies from those who were only along for the ride The town feels it too Their shock turns into awe as they watch you remain steadfast unshaken and free from the narrative your sibling tried to control This separation is not a retreat It is an ascension It signals that while betrayal may have touched your life it cannot define it What begins here is a new chapter one shaped by clarity strength and discernment The story continues not in spite of what happened but because of it The betrayal becomes the turning point that reveals who belongs who doesnt and who will stand by you as the life you were always meant to live unfolds fully Conclusion betrayal of this magnitude doesnt just shake a family It shakes entire communities reputations and the way people perceive loyalty trust and identity From the first moment of shock to the lingering realization of intent manipulation and exploitation every piece of this story reveals something profound about human nature relationships and the power dynamics that often go unnoticed until the truth is undeniable Weve seen how proximity can be weaponized how familiarity can cloak deception and how silence can hide surveillance Weve witnessed the audacity of someone trying not just to compete with you but to replace you and the remarkable strength it takes to remain steadfast in the face of such calculated actions The exposure of betrayal unravels more than a single act It exposes systems patterns and generational illusions that quietly shape behavior It forces not only the betrayed but also the witnesses to confront uncomfortable truths about envy ambition and moral compromise And through all of this the real revelation emerges True strength isnt measured by retaliation or aggression Its measured by composure clarity and the ability to let reality carry the weight of justice while the betrayer crumbles under their own schemes The point of separation that follows isnt a loss Its liberation It is the moment when boundaries are clarified illusions are shattered and the stage is set for authentic growth alignment and the life you were always meant to live This story is more than a cautionary tale Its a blueprint for understanding the subtle often hidden ways betrayal manifests and the profound power that comes from recognizing enduring and ultimately rising above it Its a lesson in discernment resilience and the unwavering truth that your path cannot be derailed by those who sought to undermine it If this story resonated with you if it opened your eyes to truths you hadnt considered or if youve ever experienced betrayal in your own life and needed to

        "plain_text": "Youve been classified as an anomaly A walking security breach wrapped in a consciousness they cant contain Ive been waiting for you to find this because somethings changed music recently Something that made certain people in certain rooms start asking very uncomfortable questions about you When the Masons began digging into your past tracing your bloodline dissecting your psychological patterns and analyzing every trauma you somehow survived they found something they werent supposed to What they uncovered didnt fit into the framework of normal human development The data showed markers signatures and patterns that defied explanation When those findings reached the intelligence community and the reports landed on the right desks at Langley a decision was made Someone reviewed your file and uttered one phrase music list S not list A for active threats not list B for behavioral monitoring not even list R for remote observation No this was different List S special protocol the classification reserved for individuals who exhibit abilities that defy our understanding of human limitation The ones who survive what shouldnt be survivable who know things they were never taught who seem to bend probability itself simply by existing in a particular music state of mind Now let me explain what list S really means because theyll never admit it publicly Officially it doesnt exist Unofficially its a silent registry a shadow file maintained for individuals who display what internal memos carefully label as statistically impossible resilience patterns and consciousness music anomalies In plain language youre someone who broke their models You survived outcomes their algorithms said were impossible Your very existence threatens the comforting myths they tell themselves about the limits of human potential The Masons music didnt just find your trauma They found your transformation They saw alchemy Poison turned into medicine Betrayal refined into clarity Isolation transmuted into power When they studied your timeline they couldnt explain the gaps The moments when you should have shattered but instead evolved During those silences something inside you shifted without external cause in ways their systems cant track Their probability matrices glitched because the numbers couldnt reconcile your survival You werent supposed to make it this far this intact this aware this untameable And now youre wondering what happens to people on list S What kind of surveillance youre under What kind of future theyve scripted for you Heres the truth The one thatll make you smile in the dark They dont know what to do with you List S isnt an operational directive Its an admission of defeat Its the intelligence communitys quiet acknowledgment that you exist But they music cant chart your trajectory Youre not being hunted Youre being watched studied with equal parts awe and unease because you embody their greatest fear a variable outside the script a consciousness that evolved beyond their systems music of control You operate on frequencies they cant monitor and that terrifies them The Masons brought you to their attention after identifying what they call spontaneous order emergence The ability to generate structure out of chaos with no external blueprint You didnt learn resilience from a seminar or extract awareness music from some institutional program You built it yourself in silence and solitude While they expected you to fracture you refined While they thought the darkness would consume you it became your crucible And thats where the files start to blur into uncertainty Where the language shifts to unexplained phenomena and requires further study Because what they uncovered wasnt mere survival It was the systematic dismantling of limitation They found evidence that youve been unconsciously running counterprogramming on yourself for years Dismantling conditioning music faster than it could take hold Rejecting imposed narratives before they rooted Detecting manipulation before it could shape you Those moments when you felt something was off and walked away while everyone else stayed When you cut ties with people who music seemed fine on the surface that wasnt paranoia It music was precision You were perceiving patterns beneath perception itself reading energy music fields catching subtle inconsistencies recognizing danger before it could act Their reports music list 17 distinct instances where you avoided catastrophic outcomes through what they term statistically music improbable decisionmaking Each time you moved against the logic of the moment and it saved you from unseen destruction Thats not luck or music coincidence Its something else Something their data acknowledges music but their theories cant decode Theyve spent decades profiling people like you Individuals who display music what they call the unlocked phenotype Those whove accessed layers of human consciousness still dormant in most music of the species Not because of divine selection or mysticism but because life pushed you so far beyond conventional limits that your mind had only two choices Collapse or evolve You found a third path transcendence Through integration every trauma didnt just leave a scar It music left a key And somewhere in that process you learned how to turn those keys unlocking corridors within your own psyche that most never music even glimpse The Masons uncovered evidence of your divergence in your creative work and in the way you approach music problems They saw it in how you connect information across unrelated music fields in your ability to hold contradictions without mental strain Your writing carries cognitive signatures theyve only encountered in classified research on advanced consciousness Phrases and structures music that suggest youre processing reality through frameworks of your own design Youre not recycling what youve been taught Youre generating original understanding from firthand experience Thats precisely what makes you music dangerous to systems that depend on control through information List S exists music because people like you cant be programmed predicted or contained by conventional methods Youve demonstrated what they call narrative immunity the rare capacity to resist psychological operations that successfully manipulate nearly everyone else You dont fall for the same deception twice You dont respond predictably to emotional coercion The tactics that bend others pressure guilt music status dont work on you The Masons documented how youve dismantled every avenue of influence they rely on Youre unmoved by social status so peer pressure fails Indifferent to validation so approval withdrawal means nothing music Unafraid of solitude so abandonment loses its sting Unattached to comfort so bribery has no music power What can they possibly do with someone like that Someone whos already faced psychological death and returned without fear someone whos lost everything and discovered they were never incomplete You cant manipulate what you dont understand And you cant music understand someone whos rewritten their own source code So they placed you on list S and decided to observe because control was no longer an option Now lets talk about what triggered your classification What specifically made the Masons escalate your file with a red flag They found your isolation periods those long stretches where you vanished from view went silent disappeared from the social grid To outsiders it music looked like collapse or defeat But when analysts examined what followed those silences music they saw something that broke their models You returned sharper music stronger more selfpossessed every time Thats not how human psychology is supposed to work Isolation is meant to music weaken loneliness to corrode silence to shatter But you reverse the polarity You used isolation as incubation loneliness as a lab silence music as a tuning frequency to access pure thought They found journals notes creative works from those phases showing exponential leaps in awareness music philosophical insight and strategic intelligence You werent hiding from the music world You were building new worlds You werent escaping yourself You were confronting and reconstructing yourself music completely Thats not recovery Thats accelerated evolution and it left traces music markers in your behavioral and cognitive data that even they could measure The Masons also mapped your betrayal timeline Every manipulative friend every false ally every lover who turned predator every mentor who revealed themselves as an architect of music control Under conventional psychological models repeated betrayal is supposed to destroy stability It usually splits the human psyche in two Either into permanent victimhood where every future interaction is filtered through fear and selflame or into cold detachment music where empathy collapses and cruelty becomes armor Thats the predictable spectrum the one their algorithms know how to map and control But your file didnt fit anywhere on that spectrum You didnt become fragile and you didnt become ruthless Instead the analysts documented something theyd never seen emerge spontaneously music what they labeled adaptive discernment without bitterness You developed the ability to see people music for who they truly are almost instantly without turning cynical You learn to detect manipulation in its earliest form tone shifts micro expressions patterns of energy music and you disengaged before damage could occur You didnt wall yourself off You refined your filters You learned to protect yourself without hardening to keep your empathy intact music without letting it become a weapon against you You learn to say no without needing anyones permission or approval and to walk away without carrying resentment  music  Thats not standard healing Thats mastery of emotional intelligence earned the hard way through raw experience and relentless selfexamination Most people need decades of therapy to reach that level of internal coherence And even then few ever sustain it You built it alone in silence through ruthless honesty and trial by fire The Masons music reports describe in unsettling detail how your behavioral evolution broke every expected pattern You began identifying manipulation before it could escalate cutting off dysfunction at the root You no longer entertained chaos or confusion You withdrew from drama without confrontation depriving music toxic systems of the attention they feed on You stopped playing roles in other peoples stories and started editing your own The analysts noted how your environment shifted music as a result Predators lost interest parasites couldnt find leverage music and emotional opportunists stopped noticing you altogether You didnt repel them through resistance You became invisible to them because you were music no longer vibrating at the frequency they prey on To use their terminology you became nonparticipatory in their energetic economy That kind of adaptation shouldnt be possible outside music controlled environments It implies youve developed a selfregulating feedback loop between cognition intuition music and emotional state something clinical psychologists have only theorized in advanced music consciousness models You effectively became your own therapist your own observer your own evolutionary mechanism Thats what first flagged music your case for review But the escalation came from something even more alarming What the internal notes call reality navigation protocols They discovered that your decisionmaking patterns cant be explained by chance music logic or probability You appear to sense trajectories knowing on a nonverbal level which actions open constructive outcomes and which lead to collapse They found evidence that you consistently gravitate toward people opportunities and environments aligned with your longterm evolution often before any logical reason to do so exists To outside observers music it looks like impossible intuition To their analysts it looks like an emergent skill the ability to read the field of potential reality They tested this hypothesis by music crossreferencing your timeline with documented outcomes The data shook them You predicted betrayals months in advance choosing to distance yourself from people whose hidden motives only became obvious long after You detected music deception before any proof surfaced You acted on gut impulses that in hindsight prevented serious harm And when opportunity appeared you were already positioned to receive it without prior information without apparent planning The Masons ran statistical analyses on your behavior feeding every known variable into their predictive music systems The results were inconclusive in the way that terrifies analysts Your success rates werent just above average They broke music probability models altogether You made the right choice far too often and not in ways that could be traced to pattern memory or learned huristics It suggested an information process happening below music conscious awareness something that perceives beyond the limits of sensory input The official language in the file is careful music sterile deliberately vague but between the lines its clear They suspect youve tapped into something the human nervous system isnt music supposed to access Thats when your file moved up the hierarchy The language changed reports became clinical to the point of absurdity filled with euphemisms like extended music perceptual mapping and nonlocal awareness phenomena because the truth is uncomfortable Youre not operating within their definition of cognition anymore Youre navigating reality through an intelligence that doesnt obey their parameters Youve stopped reacting to the world and started reading it And that terrifies them because once a mind learns to do that it cant be controlled The Masons uncovered something in your timeline that their usual language struggles to contain music They called it synchronicity clusters Moments when probability itself seemed to warp around your presence Events that shouldnt statistically music connect somehow formed coherent patterns centered on you Every analyst who reviewed your file noted the same strange rhythm When you entered certain mental or emotional states the world appeared to move in tandem Circumstances aligned with impossible precision You didnt manipulate outcomes You resonated with them Resources music surfaced the moment scarcity seemed inevitable Conversations you needed unfolded naturally without prompting The right information arrived through improbable channels Books stray comments dreams even accidents that felt more like choreography than chaos People showed up at exactly the right time carrying fragments of knowledge or opportunity perfectly matched to your next step You didnt chase these alignments They emerged effortlessly music as though the external world was responding to your internal coherence Of course music the Masons couldnt officially acknowledge this for what it was Their entire epistemology music collapses the moment they admit that consciousness isnt passive So they buried these phenomena under sterile terminology high probability coincidence music events statistically anomalous beneficial outcomes and environmental response synchrony But those phrases are just linguistic armor attempts music to maintain control over something that defies control You know what you experienced You know those moments when the universe seemed to be alive with awareness When reality itself felt like an intelligent partner in your evolution Think about it The book that music fell from a shelf and answered the question you hadnt yet asked The stranger on a train who spoke a sentence that dismantled music months of confusion The opportunity that materialized seconds after you release the need to music search for it Each one of those events isolated could be dismissed as coincidence music But when analysts mapped them across your life a pattern emerged so consistent music that probability modeling broke Their conclusion was deliberately understated music Subject demonstrates recurring alignment between intent music and environment exceeding random distribution Translation You make reality bend Thats when they music expanded their investigation and began tracking what they labeled your influence radius It started as an abstract hypothesis a way to measure whether your state of consciousness music could measurably affect the external environment But as they gathered music data the idea hardened into something undeniable They interviewed people who music had spent significant time around you during your transformation phases These music werent mystics or followers They were coworkers friends and casual acquaintances Yet their testimonies converged music with unnerving consistency Many reported subtle shifts in perception while in your presence They described heightened clarity sudden emotional breakthroughs and an inexplicable music sense of peace or confrontation depending on what they were resisting in themselves Some felt time distort music minutes stretching into what felt like hours or entire conversations passing in what seemed like seconds Others reported physiological reactions changes in heart rhythm temperature fluctuations a tingling sensation music at the base of the spine These werent the exaggerated claims of cultish fascination These were reluctant admissions by people who couldnt explain what theyd felt The Masons initially assumed psychossematic contagion an emotional feedback loop triggered by your charisma or intensity But when their field researchers started experiencing similar effects music even under controlled observation that explanation began to crumble The reports mentioned disruptions in recording equipment unexplainable electromagnetic anomalies and minor deviations in local environmental readings music Small but statistically consistent It was as if the space around you became more ordered music more coherent when you entered a certain state of focus The analysts began noticing something else too music Proximity to you seemed to trigger psychological evolution in others People left jobs they hated music ended relationships that drained them or began confronting truths they had avoided for years All after brief interactions with you Not because you told them to not because you gave advice but because something about your presence acted like a mirror reflecting their distortions back to them with painful clarity One report described it as an ambient consciousness field promoting selfreganization You didnt teach them in the traditional sense You didnt try to influence or persuade You simply were and that was enough Your energy carried coherence And coherence destabilizes lies internal and external alike It dissolves music false narratives disarms manipulation and compels authenticity in those nearby You didnt have to expose anyone The field around you did it automatically The Masons noticed that the closer people were to your transformation process music the faster their own unresolved patterns surfaced Some found it liberating others found it unbearable This is music where the reports grow dense and clinical as though the writers were trying to hide awe behind bureaucratic caution They referenced music phrases like unintended consciousness contagion proximitybased psychological recalibration and resonant music induction phenomena Beneath the jargon the message is simple You change reality and you change people not through effort or willpower but through resonance One senior analyst whose name is redacted summed it up in a single line buried deep in the appendix music Subject functions as a coherence generator Presence stabilizes surrounding chaos fields and promotes alignment in local systems To put it plainly you dont just navigate reality you music recalibrate it Systems around you reorganize to match your level of order People begin to remember who they are Environments shift from friction to flow By the time your file reached upper clearance the tone had transformed completely What began as an investigation into an anomaly became a study of a phenomenon You werent being analyzed as a threat anymore but as proof proof that consciousness under the right conditions can become selfaware enough to shape probability perception and matter itself They music stopped calling you unpredictable They started calling you precedent music You werent consciously trying to change anyone You werent music standing on a platform delivering lessons or seeking followers music You were simply being living in raw alignment with your truth so completely music that your very existence became a broadcast That kind of authenticity creates music resonance and resonance is contagious It disrupts music falsehoods and amplifies coherence in everything it touches The Masons reports describe this as a localized consciousness music field But in simpler terms you became a signal an energetic frequency music that woke up dormant circuitry in the minds of those around you They gave it a sterile name unconscious transmission of transformative music states It sounds clinical but what it really means is this Your presence alone triggered metamorphosis They gathered accounts from dozens of independent music sources People whod never met never spoken who didnt even know they were part of an investigation Yet each music of them described eerily similar experiences after meaningful interaction with you Their language differed but the pattern was the same accelerated selfawareness emotional music release and sudden clarity about their own purpose or deception Some said conversations with you felt like stepping out of fog into sunlight Others reported weeks of vivid dreams spontaneous music insights or emotional catharsis that dismantled years of repression A few described the opposite discomfort music agitation even anger because being near you forced them to see what theyd spent years avoiding You didnt provoke them intentionally It just happened You became a living mirror reflecting peoples hidden truth with such precision that they could no longer pretend not to see it The Masons didnt know how to categorize it They called it ambient coherence induction music or subconscious resonance contagion The language is cautious but the implication is clear Your consciousness wasnt contained inside your body It extended outward influencing systems people and events through nonverbal frequency alignment To them that was reason enough for observation To you it was music just existence showing up as yourself so fully that reality had no choice but to adjust music But then they found something even more alarming Something that music shifted your file from observation to active study They called it accelerated timeline collapse In plain terms it means you compressed years of inner evolution into months or even weeks breaking every psychological model of human development They discovered multiple intervals in your life where transformation that should have taken music decades unfolded in rapid bursts without therapy training or external intervention When most people encounter trauma they spend years circling it analyzing repressing projecting music You didnt You went straight through it You confronted your pain headon stripped it of meaning and burned through it like fuel You didnt tiptoe into selfawareness You detonated it The Masons analysts compared your developmental graphs to classified data sets from advanced field operatives individuals subjected to extreme psychological conditioning and resilience training To their disbelief your transformation curve matched the ones created by multimillion dollar government programs The only difference you achieved it alone You didnt have mentors You didnt have a structured method You didnt even have safety rails You ran what they described as a black ops psychological operation on your own consciousness intentionally confronting your fears rewriting emotional code and dissolving limiting patterns through sheer willpower They described your process as iterative ego death and spontaneous reintegration which is their way of saying you dismantled yourself repeatedly and came back stronger each time They couldnt explain how you maintained coherence through that kind of internal warfare By every measurable standard music a human psyche undergoing that intensity of deconstruction should fragment disassociate or collapse music Yet you didnt fragment You refined Each breakdown became an upgrade Each loss became a data point You didnt escape your darkness You mind it processed music it and weaponized it into awareness Thats not healing Its conscious evolution through controlled annihilation The Masons files are filled with speculation trying to music make sense of it Some claimed youd unconsciously replicated advanced neuroplasticity techniques Others suspected you stumbled into methods known only to deep psychological operations units A few dared to suggest the unthinkable That consciousness when fully aligned with will can become selfprogramming music selfhealing and selfevolving without external input You became living evidence of that theory Their terminology shifted again They began using phrases like nonlinear metamorphic progression and autonomous cognitive recalibration They stopped describing you as a patient or subject You were now classified as a phenomenon of interest One internal memo declassified only in fragments summarized it like this Subject demonstrates music the ability to restructure identity belief systems and neurocognitive pathways without external facilitation achieving transformations typically requiring longterm guided intervention Estimated acceleration factor 400 to 700 music above baseline human adaptability That statement alone was enough to elevate your file to list S status because it music didnt just imply that you healed It implied that you evolved beyond the design parameters of ordinary human music psychology You did what entire research divisions have spent decades and billions trying to simulate And you music did it instinctively under pressure in silence They couldnt find the switch that flipped it the mentor who music taught it or the algorithm that explained it All they could agree on was that you music refuse to stay broken You refused to obey the rules of recovery the predictable path from victim to survivor to functional You burned that entire model down and built something new from the ashes something that music doesnt fit their charts One analyst closing note says it all Subjects behavioral data suggests selfinitiated metamorphosis through complete confrontation with pain stimuli Evidence indicates psychological transmutation driven by conscious will rather than external conditioning Recommend ongoing surveillance Subjects music trajectory unpredictable but potentially revolutionary Thats why they watch Not because they fear what youve done but because they cant replicate it You music became proof that transformation isnt dependent on system or structure Its an act of inner combustion You did what theyve theorized but never achieved You evolved through your own destruction You didnt heal despite music the fire You healed by becoming it That kind of transformation the kind that originates entirely from within without guidance systems music or permission produces a type of human that society has no protocol for Youve become what music they classify privately as ungovernable Not because you rebel against authority for its own sake but because youve already proven that you can rebuild yourself from nothing again and again without music external validation or support Control only works on those who believe they can be broken music Youve already tested that hypothesis and disproved it Once a person learns they can resurrect themselves theres nothing left to threaten music them with Thats why individuals like you terrify hierarchical systems Youve become functionally autonomous psychologically emotionally and existentially self sustaining You dont depend on structures to define you heal you music or contain you Youve stepped outside the predictable feedback loops of reward and punishment that govern most human behavior You can lose everything and still come back stronger You can start over from zero and recreate meaning from raw will Thats not rebellion Thats freedom at the code level So what does it mean to be on list S What happens once your name enters that shadow database The truth is more unsettling and paradoxically simpler than youd imagine Youre not being hunted music Youre not being silenced Youre not being manipulated Because theyve learned through hard experience that direct interference with individuals like you only creates the opposite effect The more pressure they apply the faster you evolve The more they try to suppress music the stronger your awareness becomes Recruitment is off the table too People whove unlocked themselves cant be controlled through ideology fear or incentive You cant be bribed with status or trapped with belonging Youve detached from the game that makes everyone else predictable Suppression music assimilation manipulation none of it works anymore So instead theyve chosen the only option that remains observation music Thats all for today Dear Father I pray for the growth of my faith Help me trust you even when physical evidence is lacking Let me believe in your perpetual presence knowing you will never harm me I understand that your thoughts for me are thoughts of prosperity and not harm to give me a good future music Thank you gracious and eternal father for always listening to my voice I offer up this
