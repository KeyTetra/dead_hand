1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,320
There's like this deafening silence

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,320
right now.

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:24,439
If this message found you or if you

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,439
clicked on this message because

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,320
the title of it called you in,

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,719
then this message is 100% for you. And

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,719
this is a message for people who are not

8
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,440
in divine partnership yet. Okay? Like

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,640
this is a pretty obvious message. You're

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,480
not in a relationship right now or yet,

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,079
right?

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,600
And this is one of those messages where

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,399
the angels are coming through really

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,840
strongly

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,160
and they're telling me

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,039
they're saying

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,520
use your willpower

18
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,439
for this message and if you make it to

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,360
the end of this message it'll make

20
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,920
sense.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,119
But we're going to start in a place that

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,760
might not make any sense to you.

23
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,760
So, what I'm hearing

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,600
is that the angels are scheming. The

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:29,600
angels are scheming. Okay,

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,560
this is about love.

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,000
But the angels are saying that they

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
pulled you into this message

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,320
specifically using the title of this

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,840
message

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,040
because

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,040
it's actually the complete opposite.

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,799
So stay with me. Like I said,

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,600
patience,

35
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,600
good things come to those who wait.

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Okay.

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,360
I'm feeling

38
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,360
a sense of

39
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,920
anger at love.

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,840
I'm feeling a sense of anger at

41
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,560
yourself.

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,040
And I'm feeling a sense of I almost want

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,319
to say like there's just this part of

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,239
you that's like rising that's like a a

45
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,200
little bit angry at the universe but

46
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:31,280
like not at the same time. Okay.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,879
And this energy is um

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,400
swirling around inside of you

49
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,280
and creating this deafening silence. I

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,680
feel like there is a part of you

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,560
that feels kind of disgusted by the

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,760
thought of love right now. And when I

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,640
say disgusted, it's because love hasn't

54
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,680
stopped teaching you lessons.

55
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,440
Love hasn't softened. It's not that love

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,959
hasn't softened. I feel like love has

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,680
softened if you really look at your

58
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,680
history of love. But I'm getting love

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,480
hasn't softened in the way that you

60
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,599
feel like you know that it's supposed to

61
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,599
soften. Okay.

62
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,000
And I feel like this is a

63
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,760
funny message because it's almost like

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,760
the angels called you here to be like,

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,080
"We're going to tell you some truths

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,239
right now. We're going to give you some

67
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,720
truth bombs.

68
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,319
So, as I was driving this morning, I was

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,760
like, "Okay, I'm just going to open my

70
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,840
channel to the angels and I'm going to

71
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
see what they want to say and I'm going

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,599
to give them space and I'm going to give

73
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,159
them time because I didn't even know if

74
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,560
I was going to channel today. I've woken

75
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,640
up super late. Everything has gone so

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,159
much slower than I expected it to." And

77
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,000
I feel like that's very um reflective of

78
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,120
your journey in love.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
I feel like there's going to be a bit of

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
a throat block coming through here in

81
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,480
this message. So, if I'm coughing or if

82
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,239
I'm like um slowing down to take drinks

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,799
and I drink or breathe, it's because

84
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,599
there is a lot

85
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,320
coming up and clearing in this message.

86
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,320
Okay. And

87
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,560
again, so I was driving this morning

88
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,240
and I was like,

89
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,919
I'm going to get a coffee today. coffee

90
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,160
could be significant for someone. It's

91
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,160
like I'm gonna get a coffee. And as I

92
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,199
was going to get my coffee, I heard the

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,199
angels say.

94
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,120
Now's not the time.

95
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,720
They didn't say exactly that. There's

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,160
like a white bird on the fence right

97
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
now. This could be significant for

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,280
someone. Hi, buddy. Are you trying to

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,280
say hi to people?

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,759
He literally like peeked his neck out

101
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,759
and he was like,

102
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,479
"Um,

103
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,479
okay.

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,400
Love has been slower for you than I feel

105
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,039
like it has been for other people."

106
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,120
And I think it pisses you off to be

107
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,400
completely honest. I think it like it

108
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,639
doesn't really because I feel like

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,320
you've been softening into that but

110
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,080
there's also this part of you I feel

111
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,479
like there's this really divine sense of

112
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,199
anger inside of you or rage like a

113
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,360
divine rage that has been coming up

114
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,680
inside of you recently and it's funny

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,560
because it's tied to love and it's also

116
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,240
tied to your love for yourself. So, what

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,320
I heard from the angels is that this

118
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,840
message called you in because there's a

119
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,000
part of you that's like, "Oh, is love

120
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
coming?" Like, ew, like I don't want

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,960
love, but like, "Oh, I do want love."

122
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,360
You know, like there's this part of you

123
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,600
that's like you're opening yourself for

124
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,600
it. And at the exact same time, you're

125
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,479
angry at it, but it's because you're

126
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,680
angry at yourself in the terms of love.

127
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,759
Okay? It's not like you're like looking

128
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,759
at yourself and you're like, I'm not I'm

129
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,240
not happy with you. Okay? It's not that

130
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,240
kind of an energy.

131
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,240
I told you mucus. I don't know.

132
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,400
There's going to be clearing in this

133
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,400
message. I'm like I can I can feel that.

134
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,720
But the angels called you into this

135
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,120
message to basically say

136
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,199
it's not time yet.

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,440
But they called you in by making you

138
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,360
think it's time.

139
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
So, that's what I mean by they're being

140
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,360
a little sneaky. They're being a little

141
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,280
sneaky with you because they're

142
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,280
basically trying to sit you down and say

143
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,039
right now, the only person that you're

144
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,800
supposed to be in love with is yourself.

145
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,400
Right now, the only person that you're

146
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
supposed to be showing up for is

147
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,639
yourself.

148
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,800
right now, the only person that you're

149
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,240
supposed to be diving into and giving

150
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,199
your energy to is yourself. And I think

151
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,240
that that's um I think you know this,

152
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,280
which is why this is like hard. And I

153
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,199
also think that recently

154
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:29,120
the journey of love for you has been

155
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:33,840
slower than expected, has had weird

156
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,080
twists or turns and has really brought

157
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,479
up this anger inside of you or this part

158
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,800
of you that's like feeling that divine

159
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,479
rage. And it's brought it up because

160
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,160
there's a part of yourself which has

161
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,120
been abandoning yourself in order to

162
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,840
make love happen. Okay? When love is

163
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,120
meant to happen for you, you're not

164
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,560
supposed to make it happen.

165
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,319
And this is a super uncomfortable

166
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,919
energy. And I'm moving the camera a

167
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,599
bunch because you know me, that's just

168
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,479
what happens. I move the camera when I'm

169
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,479
really uncomfortable. Um,

170
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,240
but I'm also getting this energy of

171
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,199
nothing is as it seems. So, it's funny

172
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,039
because all this all this divine rage

173
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,840
that's coming up in you right now in

174
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,599
terms of love is coming up for a reason.

175
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,479
And it's coming up because you're

176
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,280
finally ready to face the ways that

177
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,160
you've abandoned yourself in the pursuit

178
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,479
of love. Okay? Because this is very

179
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,560
significant because all of your energy

180
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,320
and essence is meant to be redirected

181
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,320
back onto you and

182
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:47,839
it's a hard decision to make.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,839
It is hard to choose yourself. And the

184
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,560
way that your divine partner comes in is

185
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
through the choosing of yourself. And

186
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,240
what's funny is that I'm getting this

187
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,839
vibe of like you kind of have this part

188
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,279
of you that's also angry at everything

189
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,680
that's being said right now because

190
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,760
you're like I have been choosing myself.

191
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Like I have been showing up for myself

192
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,880
more than I've ever shown up for myself.

193
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,440
Ooh, confirmation in my entire life.

194
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,959
Like I have showed up for myself. What

195
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,360
are you talking about? Like I've worked

196
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,640
so hard to show up for myself and I'm

197
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,519
getting that energy. Okay. And that's

198
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,519
that divine rage, right? Let that come

199
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,519
up

200
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,399
first. You're allowed to be angry.

201
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,959
You're also allowed to witness where the

202
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,640
anger stems from. Okay, which is that

203
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,920
self-abandonment.

204
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,080
And that's hard. Okay, this isn't an

205
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,200
easy energy.

206
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,200
But what I am getting is that

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,120
you're supposed to be

208
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,160
in this journey right now, which you're

209
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,519
already in, but you're in this journey

210
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,440
where you're learning to choose yourself

211
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,760
over

212
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm almost getting like over the pursuit

213
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,200
of love

214
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,279
in ways that you know, love isn't fully

215
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:17,839
meant to arrive for you. Okay, so

216
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:20,880
kind of vague, but kind of specific.

217
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,720
It's almost as if you've been choosing

218
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,480
yourself and then you get to this point

219
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,000
where you've been choosing yourself and

220
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,560
then an opportunity comes in to love.

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,440
And in the pursuit of love, you choose

222
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,519
love and you choose that experience

223
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,399
of loving

224
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,040
But I almost get this vibe that you're

225
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,480
someone who just like loves like I feel

226
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,000
like and this is I'm getting such a hard

227
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,399
energy like such a throat block because

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,399
I feel like when you love you give away

229
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,480
love instead of loving through loving

230
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,920
yourself and choosing yourself. And I

231
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,720
think that's the lesson that you're

232
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,560
learning right now. And it's not really

233
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,320
that you're like being taught this hard

234
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,440
lesson.

235
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,720
It's more so that you're learning to

236
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:17,120
love yourself, to love others, and to

237
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,320
give to yourself, to give to others, and

238
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,240
to choose yourself,

239
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,880
to choose others, and for others to

240
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,040
choose you. And it's in this journey

241
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,800
that it it's so it's so important

242
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:36,480
for you to be learning to choose

243
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:39,360
yourself right now. Even though it feels

244
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,800
hard, even though you're angry, even

245
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,880
though you're pissed off at love or

246
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,720
blaming whatever concept you want to

247
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,440
blame, right? whatever comes up inside

248
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,880
of you, even though you're wanting to do

249
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,800
that, it's this this is so important for

250
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,720
you to be feeling these things. And

251
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,880
that's what I'm feeling from your angels

252
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,760
right now is that this is such an

253
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,680
important time for you to be in this

254
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,360
energy and to let all of this come up

255
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,920
because something that is happening in

256
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,120
this journey specifically for you is

257
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,600
this really beautiful unmasking of the

258
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,160
ways that you've abandoned yourself and

259
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,920
this really beautiful witnessing of the

260
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,480
versions of yourself that haven't shown

261
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,639
up for you so that you can be more of

262
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,040
you. And I feel like it's so important

263
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:30,480
because your divine lover

264
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,279
is going to love all of you. And they

265
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,600
are not meant to show up until you love

266
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,480
all of you. And in order to love all of

267
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,639
you, you have to unmask all the versions

268
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,160
of you. All the versions of you that are

269
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,600
angry, all the versions of you that are

270
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,800
sad, all of the versions of you that

271
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,600
have abandoned yourself. And you have to

272
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,920
merge with them. And this is that

273
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,160
process that is happening right now. And

274
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,040
it's happening through your pursuit of

275
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,920
love and learning how to be in the

276
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,240
pursuit of loving thyself in order to

277
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,639
love others. And I feel like this is so

278
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,639
important, so significant for you

279
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,639
because there's just something so

280
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,320
profound about the connection that

281
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,560
you're truly meant to be in. And

282
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:19,920
I just get this vibe that you have a

283
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:22,000
deeper purpose in love. like you have

284
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,800
it's almost like I feel like you really

285
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,959
came here with a like part of your sole

286
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:31,040
purpose being on earth is to love. Okay,

287
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,360
it's not as simple as like yeah love is

288
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,200
cool but it's like it's part of your

289
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,920
written prophecy to love and to love in

290
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,639
a way that teaches others how to love

291
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,040
fully. And in order to do that, I just

292
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,839
feel like this is so powerful for you

293
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,760
because in order to do that, you have to

294
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,440
go through the heroine journey or the

295
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,519
hero's journey. Sorry. I've never done

296
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,800
female before male before. That's funny.

297
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:03,279
That's cute. Um, but you have to go

298
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:07,440
through that journey in order to

299
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,079
be that person that teaches. Okay. So I

300
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,560
like your angels are basically saying

301
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:18,480
that you have to experience it first if

302
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:24,320
you're bound to teach it by being okay.

303
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:27,760
And so that's why it feels um s like

304
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,480
such a challenge. Like love for you

305
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,040
feels like a challenge.

306
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,680
And love for you feels like a challenge

307
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,920
that keeps getting steeper. It's like

308
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,800
you're you thought you were climbing a

309
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,079
mountain and then you thought you were

310
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,399
climbing a snowy mountain and then you

311
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,760
got to the deeper parts of the snow and

312
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,320
it got colder and suddenly suddenly the

313
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,399
oxygen became minimal and you were like

314
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
I thought this was hard before but like

315
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,680
now I can't breathe

316
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,920
and then you realize oh I'm climbing

317
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,199
Mount Everest.

318
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,000
You're like, "My my challenge is Mount

319
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,480
Everest.

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,199
What the [ __ ] bro?"

321
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,000
And you're like reserving oxygen at the

322
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,000
same time. And you're like,

323
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,160
I don't know why this is so good, but

324
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,160
I'm just

325
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,160
It's funny because it's not funny. And

326
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,839
there's so much anger in this and like

327
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,240
irritation

328
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,240
in this journey that you're on that it's

329
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,560
actually funny. Like I feel like there

330
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,320
are moments in your journey of the

331
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,000
pursuit of love where you have genuinely

332
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
looked at everything or had things

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,279
happen in your journey of love and

334
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,040
you've been like this is [ __ ] You

335
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,639
know, like I just get this vibe that you

336
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,920
think it's funny but it's like not at

337
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,920
the same time. Like I feel like you've

338
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,399
been like real irritated and like mad at

339
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,399
love and like whatever, right? like

340
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,399
however it has come up for you, I'm

341
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,639
getting this vibe of like it's just been

342
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,399
like not cool. But then I think that

343
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,240
there's these really random moments that

344
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,759
you have where you sit back and you

345
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,959
laugh and you go, "This is a [ __ ]

346
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:17,680
joke, bro." Like, okay, I see I see how

347
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,680
my angels are probably laughing on the

348
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,759
other side at me trying to do this love

349
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:26,399
thing because what the [ __ ] bro?

350
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,079
Like I just get this this vibe from you.

351
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,399
And I do think that you have this really

352
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,639
great humor to you. I feel like that is

353
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,440
so significant.

354
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,040
But here's the thing. Okay,

355
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,279
now we can start talking about like the

356
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,040
love part because if you've made it this

357
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,480
far again, like I said that in the

358
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,720
beginning of this message and the angels

359
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,880
told me to go so slow with this energy

360
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,199
cuz they were like it's only the people

361
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,800
that have the willpower to stick around

362
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,279
that are really meant to receive this

363
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,600
message. And they told me that on the

364
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,120
drive. They they showed me how to start

365
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,920
this channelneled message and how to go

366
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,680
slow with it and breathe with it. Okay?

367
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,799
Because

368
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,439
that's also in representation of your

369
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,559
patience. Like your patience is about to

370
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,039
be rewarded, but you're still climbing

371
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,839
Mount Everest.

372
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,240
Like I'm getting this energy that like

373
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,120
you are about to be rewarded in

374
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,679
significant ways in love in a partner, a

375
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,679
divine partner that you know is meant

376
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,240
for you, that you've had dreams about,

377
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,160
that you have literally always felt for

378
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,679
you. They're going to blow your [ __ ]

379
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,200
mind. Like they're going to show you

380
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,280
that there are worlds that you have

381
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,679
never really truly like understood exist

382
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,160
when they arrive.

383
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,520
It's happening for you, okay? And it's I

384
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,400
am getting that it's sooner than you

385
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,039
think it is, but it's also set up in

386
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,400
your reality to arrive in a way that you

387
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,480
will never know when it's going to

388
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,280
happen. And that's like that's really

389
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:03,440
hard, too, cuz I can feel for you. This

390
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,760
is so good that your lover is set up to

391
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,000
be hidden from you until the day they

392
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,240
are meant to arrive. So, you're not

393
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,400
going to [ __ ] know, bro. Like, you're

394
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,240
you're not going to see it coming. And

395
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,799
that's the best part about this entire

396
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,960
thing. I literally feel like you're h

397
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,960
What's that one song? The white bird is

398
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,160
back over there.

399
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,160
It's called Love in the Dark.

400
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,440
I can't play it for you, but that's kind

401
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,520
of what I'm feeling. Like I feel like

402
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,400
you're like learning to love in the

403
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,080
unknown, like in the dark, and you're

404
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,480
not supposed to see what's coming next

405
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,400
for you. But there's this really really

406
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,160
significant journey that you're on right

407
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,360
in this exact moment when this message

408
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,120
has found you. Right.

409
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,799
And I'm also getting an ache in the back

410
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,799
of my masculine side.

411
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,200
Like I almost feel like

412
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,240
I feel like love has pronounced you

413
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,919
to be the leader

414
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,039
in a partnership that was always meant

415
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,840
to be masculine and feminine. And I'm

416
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,200
almost getting that like you have had to

417
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,360
take on the role of the opposing

418
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
end. And I I feel like a majority of

419
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,120
this collective is feminine. I'm going

420
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,480
to be honest with you. Um, but there are

421
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,559
some masculines here. So, I'm going to

422
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:31,280
keep it um open to all energies, but I'm

423
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,520
just feeling that like for the majority

424
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,520
or for everyone in this collective

425
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,840
literally, you have had to take on the

426
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,919
opposing end of the energy of your

427
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,960
divine partner

428
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,720
because you were almost like what

429
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,679
they're telling me is that you

430
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,720
This is so cool.

431
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,679
They're saying that you have lived both

432
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,120
ends of a divine partnership through

433
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,120
yourself. And that's what's still

434
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,360
happening right now where you've taken

435
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,120
on the role of both your divine partner

436
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,039
and yourself in this connection. So that

437
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,039
when this person does arrive also,

438
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,960
you're going to have a level of

439
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,120
compassion, respect, and gratitude for

440
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,600
them in your reality because you

441
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,559
understand how much effort and love they

442
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,160
put in because you've done it for

443
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,400
yourself and done it in the ways that

444
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,520
they're going to show up. Like I just

445
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,960
feel like there's a part of you that

446
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,480
like almost doesn't even believe in love

447
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,880
anymore. It's not that you don't believe

448
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,559
in love, okay, that's kind of harsh, but

449
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,000
I I feel like there's this part of you

450
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,679
that's just like kind of fed up with

451
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,799
love and you're just like, I'm kind of

452
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,159
like sick of wanting it, you know? Like

453
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,520
there's a part of you that's just like

454
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,840
annoyed at the fact that you still want

455
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,000
love. But deep down, you know that

456
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,840
you're meant to experience love. And so

457
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,720
this is just so significant because when

458
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,520
it does come in for you, it is going to

459
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,919
literally like you're going to have so

460
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,559
much gratitude for it because of how

461
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,640
much you have experienced both ends of

462
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,880
it. And also the parts of it that like

463
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,919
you in your divine like union are meant

464
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,240
to be more melty in one end of it.

465
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,640
you've done both ends for so long that

466
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,960
you're going to you're never ever going

467
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,799
to forget. And I feel like that's really

468
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,159
important too because there's a part of

469
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,520
you that like when you enter into love,

470
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,159
you may have like a fear that like Yeah,

471
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,159
I feel this coming through.

472
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,679
Hold on.

473
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,120
I feel like there's a part of you that

474
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,120
has a fear that when love does finally

475
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,720
come in and you really want it and you

476
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,280
really

477
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,039
know it's your person, I feel like

478
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,360
there's you're someone who's going to

479
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,000
know who your person is when you meet

480
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,400
them. Oo, that's a confirmation, too.

481
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,880
Like, you're going to know in your bones

482
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,159
that that's your person. And yet, I feel

483
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,799
like there's a part of you that's going

484
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,919
to worry that you're going to fall out

485
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,600
of love.

486
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,280
like and I I think that's one of your

487
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,280
fears actually. Like it really feels

488
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,039
like it's coming up as like a fear in

489
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,039
love is that there's a part of you that

490
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,200
worries that you won't continue to fall

491
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,880
more and more in love because there's a

492
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,600
part of you that I feel like you've

493
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,600
experienced this in past relationships

494
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,720
or uh connections where you've been able

495
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,440
to love fall in love fall so deeply in

496
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,960
love and then and then fall out of love.

497
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,120
I feel like that's been a repetitive

498
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,640
pattern and you I don't think you have

499
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,039
ever found someone that you've fallen

500
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,720
more in love with over time like again

501
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,799
and again and again and I think that

502
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,679
that's because you haven't met your

503
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,320
divine person yet and that's also hard

504
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,360
because it's almost like your your your

505
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,880
reality has taught you that or made you

506
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,159
think I don't want to say like really

507
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,200
taught you because there's a part of you

508
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:59,360
that knows deeper but your reality has

509
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,000
made you think that or has created this

510
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,120
fear inside of you that you don't know

511
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,080
if there is someone out there that will

512
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:13,600
rise to the occasion of you and

513
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,159
continue to be someone that you want to

514
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,840
rem meet over and over and over and

515
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,360
refell in love with over and over and

516
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,960
over and over. Like it almost feel like

517
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,720
there's a part of you that almost like

518
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,640
again like you feel fed up with love and

519
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,559
you almost like don't believe it

520
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,120
anymore. Even though there's a part of

521
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,960
you because this is such a part of your

522
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,600
purpose in this world. There's a part of

523
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,240
you that knows better and knows stronger

524
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,159
and knows more divinely that that it's

525
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,480
there. And so when you get mad at it,

526
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,559
it's almost like this reflective Hold

527
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,280
on. It's it's almost like this

528
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:48,799
reflective energy that happens for you

529
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,600
where you get angry at love, but then

530
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,520
you get angry at yourself because you

531
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,320
know that love is there. And so instead,

532
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,159
you're just like getting mad in this

533
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,159
circle and then it gets like I feel like

534
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,159
there's this big part of love and the

535
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,400
anger that you feel with love that gets

536
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,600
like turned on to yourself and I think

537
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,320
that that's something that you're also

538
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,760
growing through cuz how long is this

539
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,760
message going to be? because this is a

540
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:16,400
much deeper, longer message than I

541
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:19,360
expected it to be. Um,

542
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,039
what I'm feeling for you is that right

543
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,039
now, cuz let's talk about right this

544
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,919
moment, right?

545
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,640
Because I feel like right now in this

546
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,640
moment, you're like, "Ew, what the

547
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,080
fuck?" And I feel like there's this

548
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,640
energy that you have where you're just

549
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:39,279
kind of like fade or faded. There's this

550
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,799
part of you that's just like

551
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,200
irritated with love where you're just

552
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,720
like I'm done. Like I almost get this

553
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
like fed up energy. That's what I was

554
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,080
trying to say. Fed up. It's a fed up

555
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,279
energy at love. And it's actually,

556
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,279
again, we already talked about this.

557
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,240
It's a fed up energy at the version of

558
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:59,279
you that has abandoned yourself every

559
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,360
single time love has been an option. and

560
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,039
you've abandoned yourself in order to

561
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:08,159
try and attain that love even though you

562
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,919
knew deeper down that that wasn't it for

563
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,240
you that there was something deeper out

564
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,000
there and I think that that's something

565
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,679
that's also really hard for you because

566
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,640
I think you understand that there are

567
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,039
certain lessons that you asked for in

568
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,200
love to of course bring you to this part

569
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,080
of yourself like again this like this

570
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,720
present storyline that you're living

571
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,640
is about you

572
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,080
falling in love with yourself. It's

573
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,760
about you choosing yourself. And that's

574
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,480
why you're getting these opportunities

575
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,640
also to love where it's almost like

576
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,960
you're getting these amazing

577
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,039
opportunities that look like shiny gold

578
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,480
stars, right? And you're like, "Oh my

579
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,880
god, I want the gold star. I want the

580
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,880
gold star." And it's almost like the

581
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,360
gold star is twodimensional.

582
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,520
It's a sticker, but you thought it was a

583
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,200
3D opportunity at love. You know what I

584
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,960
mean? Like you thought it was like a 5D

585
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,440
opportunity. You were like, "Oh my god."

586
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,360
But then you give all of yourself over

587
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,799
to reaching for this star and when you

588
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,360
reach it, you peel it off and you're

589
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,960
like, "It's a sticker. It's a 2D

590
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,200
sticker."

591
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,960
You're like, "Okay, I'm mad. I'm mad.

592
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,360
Why did I just completely unoute myself

593
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,799
in order to reach this 2D sticker?" And

594
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,159
so I feel like you've had a lot of these

595
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:27,039
experiences in love where you've done

596
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:30,559
this over and over and over again. And

597
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:33,039
you've done this because you're you're

598
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:37,840
getting these experiences to basically

599
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:39,760
reroute you on the path of choosing

600
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,679
yourself. Okay, my battery I'm going to

601
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,760
change it really quick. Anyways,

602
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,080
you're on these experiences. is you're

603
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,960
getting all these experiences so that

604
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,120
you can be rerouted back again and again

605
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,720
and again to choosing yourself. And I

606
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,600
feel like this message is arriving for

607
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,400
you at a really it's an irritable time,

608
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,640
but it's an awesome time because this

609
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,120
message is arriving when you're finally

610
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,360
feeling like you're not going to take

611
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,960
the gold star. Like there's a part of

612
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,120
you that's like, I don't want another 2D

613
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,440
star. I want to stay on my path of

614
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,000
choosing myself and a star will appear

615
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,240
on my path. I'm seeing Mario Kart right

616
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,400
now like a star when they're driving and

617
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,640
they're like it's just right there

618
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,679
available for you. That's what I feel is

619
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,279
coming for you. Okay. And I I do just

620
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,720
keep getting this message and this vibe

621
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,720
that like right now I know that like

622
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,440
everyone wants to hear like your

623
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,520
soulmate's coming and they're right

624
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,360
around the corner and they're going to

625
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,919
show up for you and they're going to be

626
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,640
here for you. And

627
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,159
this is not that message. It's not that

628
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,360
that's not true, but this message is

629
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,880
your soulmate will you will not know

630
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,240
they're coming till the day that they

631
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,240
show up. And that's the honest truth of

632
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,240
it. And the honest truth of it is that

633
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,360
they're not going to show up unless you

634
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,679
choose yourself. So this message is

635
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,960
pretty much also your angels cheering

636
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,120
you on and giving you guidance to say

637
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,360
choose you. Like if you want to feel

638
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,640
chosen, if you want a partner that's

639
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,600
going to choose you, choose you first

640
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,080
and stick the stick to the guns. You

641
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:30,320
know what I mean? Like

642
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:33,679
do not veer off your own path and let a

643
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,799
gold star concept pull you away from

644
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,960
your divine destiny because this is such

645
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,919
a big lesson for you and it's almost

646
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,480
like your partner I feel is also on this

647
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,799
journey where like they keep getting

648
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,720
disappointed by love too and it's

649
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,200
because you guys are meant for each

650
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,120
other. Like I know that I know that

651
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,039
there's all that energy that's like are

652
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,039
there really soulmates and are people

653
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,120
really meant for us and like don't you

654
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,520
just choose them and all the reasons

655
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,320
that you could say in your head is to

656
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,880
get mad at at love again, right? But

657
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,640
what I'm feeling is that there really is

658
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,240
something so divine about you

659
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,520
specifically

660
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,240
and your your purpose in love. I feel

661
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,520
like this is a message for a collective

662
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,440
of beings that are genuinely meant to

663
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:26,320
teach in love and teach in love by being

664
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,640
in love and by finding love in a very

665
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,159
specific way. And I feel like that's a

666
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,760
lesson or like a something that you're

667
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,720
meant to continue to teach throughout

668
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,159
the rest of your life. And your story is

669
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,000
going to be so powerful in that journey.

670
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,080
like your story and the way that you

671
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,720
talk about love, especially in the years

672
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,559
to come. I feel like especially because

673
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,840
there's that throat block that we had

674
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,520
come through too. Anytime that there's a

675
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,399
throat block, I think it has to do with

676
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,120
the fact that your voice is so powerful

677
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,039
and you're meant to speak. Okay? And I

678
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,559
feel like you're meant to speak upon

679
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,039
love. You're going to be telling stories

680
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,159
throughout your life, maybe even some of

681
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,960
you for mass collectives

682
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,880
about the ways that you found love. And

683
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,120
it's really important that the story

684
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,279
that you're telling is about how you

685
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
chose yourself first. And I feel like

686
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,840
that's part of your divine destiny of

687
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,960
love because you came here also at this

688
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:31,480
time on earth in order to bring love to

689
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,480
a new a new

690
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,120
I'm hearing dimension like to basically

691
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,320
like create a new level of love that

692
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,520
exists on this planet and that has to

693
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,159
happen through loving thyself and you're

694
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,799
one of the I'm getting like you could be

695
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,039
a thought leader, but I'm getting like a

696
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,679
thought leader in terms of love in this

697
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:58,720
world. Um, so it's almost like you're

698
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:03,200
one of the first wave of people that's

699
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,960
here to tell a story about love that has

700
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,840
been

701
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,679
unwritten or written over is what I'm

702
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,640
getting. So, it's almost like your story

703
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,240
of love is going to be a story that

704
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,279
writes

705
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,080
or rewrites a concept that has been long

706
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,039
forgotten about love that has been

707
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,480
removed from history books about love

708
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,399
that has been written over or unwritten.

709
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,640
I'm getting confirmation of this, too.

710
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,159
So, I feel like I also like get the vibe

711
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,880
that like this comes from a soul that

712
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,519
has

713
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,320
a dimensional history is what I'm

714
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,159
hearing. So, I feel like you could be a

715
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,720
very old soul, but I'm getting that your

716
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,640
soul may have lived in many places other

717
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,559
than just Earth. Okay? feel like your

718
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:58,559
soul is dimensionally historic and

719
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:02,399
that's why you have the memory in you

720
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,480
already to tell a story and experience a

721
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:08,080
story of love in this way and it's to

722
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,240
bring it back. I also feel like

723
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,880
there is a lot of that happening on

724
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,559
earth at this time where there's a lot

725
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,799
of historic souls that have knowledge

726
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,919
deeper inside them in their aosic

727
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:26,159
history that has been forgotten,

728
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:28,399
unwritten or written over by humanity.

729
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,200
And I feel like a lot of these teachings

730
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:34,000
and this knowledge that has always

731
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,039
existed but has been forgotten is being

732
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,840
brought back through souls like yours

733
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,000
which are meant to

734
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,240
retell the story and make new history.

735
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,200
Like I Ooh, I just got full body chills

736
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,200
for that. It's like in the concept of

737
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,600
Earth, you're going to be making history

738
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,600
with these stories that you're living to

739
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,799
tell, but they're actually such a

740
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,200
historic natural phenomenon that has

741
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:06,720
existed before, but has been unwritten

742
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:10,000
by um Earth Earth society.

743
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,320
That is so [ __ ] cool, bro. I have

744
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,519
like also sworn a lot in this message.

745
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:21,799
I'm so sorry. Pardon my French. Um,

746
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,799
this was a cool message. I

747
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,039
hold strong, my friend.

748
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,679
I actually really feel like this is

749
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,760
going to be like got a message the other

750
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,919
day that was like the new you or this

751
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,320
version of you is about to shatter the

752
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,720
paradigm. And I really feel like that is

753
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,640
so true for this part of this journey,

754
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,799
this part of your story as well, because

755
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,360
I feel like this is that moment where

756
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,279
you stop taking turns off of your own

757
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,760
path to grab stars that look 3D but end

758
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,760
up being two-dimensional or look 5D and

759
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,600
end up being two-dimensional, right?

760
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,720
Like this is that's going to be such a

761
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,840
this is such a big time for you because

762
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,760
you're choosing you. And that's so

763
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,359
incredibly powerful. I don't think you

764
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,599
even realize how powerful that is

765
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,520
because you may even have confirmation

766
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,119
of this in your physical world where

767
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,960
like certain moves that you're making

768
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,320
right now like some people are looking

769
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,839
at you and being like, "Oh, that's like

770
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,280
actually really [ __ ] cool that you're

771
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,040
doing that." Like that's actually like

772
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,280
really inspirational. Like, and you

773
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,800
might have confirmation of that through

774
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,159
people in your life where you're like,

775
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,760
"Oh, like this is huge. Like this is a

776
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,760
big deal that like and I'm not doing

777
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,040
this for anyone. and I'm doing this for

778
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,560
me. And also, I feel like there's

779
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,480
another little message here about this

780
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,280
anger that you've been feeling, this

781
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,119
divine anger. And I feel like again,

782
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,040
it's an opportunity. I don't know why

783
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,000
this is coming through again, but it's

784
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,000
an opportunity for you to look at

785
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,560
yourself and hold yourself in all the

786
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,400
ways that you have abandoned yourself.

787
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,520
Okay?

788
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,119
because you have literally gone off path

789
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,480
and that was a version of you that

790
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,800
abandoned your rightful

791
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,920
um abundance.

792
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,839
It's a version of you that

793
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,640
has you've always known that you have

794
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:19,520
this beautiful divine path, but you've

795
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,680
literally run off course. And that anger

796
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,000
that you're feeling is for the version

797
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,960
of you that let something false or some

798
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,359
kind of an illusion lead you astray.

799
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,760
You're feeling anger for that. But in

800
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,599
reality, it's just like running through

801
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,760
a maze. Okay, I'm seeing like a video

802
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,079
game of a maze. You don't get mad at

803
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,240
Pac-Man when Pac-Man goes up and goes

804
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,760
left and goes down and then accidentally

805
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,280
runs into a corner that has nowhere else

806
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,720
to go, but you have to turn back around.

807
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,400
You don't get mad at Pac-Man. You just

808
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,000
go, "Oh shit." And then you just twist

809
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,240
and you go back the other way until you

810
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,320
can go eat the other things. And so

811
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,240
that's kind of like how your angels are

812
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,359
guiding you to be like instead of

813
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,079
looking like that abandonment. Um you're

814
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,079
looking at it with like a view of that

815
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,560
was wrong

816
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,880
in reality it was just you exploring and

817
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,880
that's okay.

818
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,079
It may may feel like you could have

819
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,640
gotten things sooner like love. It may

820
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,200
feel like, oh, if I didn't do that,

821
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,640
maybe I would have hit love sooner. But

822
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,119
in reality, you probably wouldn't have

823
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,359
like you, even if you didn't take that

824
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,440
turn, you would have gone up ahead and

825
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,359
you probably would have still needed the

826
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,920
experience that you had in order to know

827
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,680
that that was a wrong turn. And I feel

828
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,040
like there's a part of you that just um

829
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,680
is almost being like guided right now.

830
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,680
Bang, bang, bang.

831
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,280
I don't know if you guys could hear

832
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,520
that, but someone was banging on

833
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,200
something.

834
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,040
Um, there's a part of you that's being

835
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,520
guided right now, too. Uh, remember that

836
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,640
every turn that you have made has been

837
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,960
an opportunity for soul growth. And

838
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,280
that's beautiful. And that rage, yes,

839
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,680
you can feel it, but also don't direct

840
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,320
it towards yourself.

841
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,119
Remember that you learned a turn was a

842
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,079
dead end. And that's knowledge. That's

843
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,079
education. That's power for you because

844
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,599
now you know not to do that again,

845
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,440
right? And even if you do accidentally

846
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,520
do it again, that's okay. I feel like

847
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,880
you won't, but if you do, it's okay.

848
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,520
You'll be like, "Oh [ __ ] like Pac-Man."

849
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,680
It's just it's fun and you'll you'll get

850
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,680
there. And I know that love has felt

851
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,359
slow for you. I know that it feels like

852
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,040
sometimes love is never actually going

853
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,760
to be real for you, that it's never

854
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,440
actually going to arrive. But through

855
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,800
this message and the energies that I

856
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,079
have felt um it's not possible for it

857
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,960
not to arrive. Like you have too much of

858
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,599
a divine connection to love for it not

859
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,480
to arrive in your lifetime, this

860
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,640
lifetime. And it is going to. But

861
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,079
remember, just take all of your energy

862
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,160
right now to hold yourself, love

863
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,040
yourself, witness the versions of you

864
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,839
that you feel have abandoned you, and

865
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,880
thank them for being a part of you and

866
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,200
for teaching you a lesson, and move on

867
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,119
and say, "I'm going up and right and

868
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,000
left now."

869
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,320
Okay? And your lover is going to

870
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,960
surprise the [ __ ] out of you when they

871
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:29,200
just come out of absolutely nowhere. And

872
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,680
it's going to be epic. It's going to be

873
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,760
epic, dude.

874
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,680
Okay. I love you so much. And if this

875
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,359
message resonated with you or found you,

876
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,000
I would literally love to know. Send me

877
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:43,200
a cute little message on Instagram um

878
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,680
about about love and I'll know that you

879
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,520
came from this message. Uh but I love

880
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,079
you guys and I will see you in the next

881
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,079
message.
