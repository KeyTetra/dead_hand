1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,440
Hunter Hunter chapter 1 is a big deal.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,279
Not just because it's different from the

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,280
anime episode one. We all know that

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,800
Togashi had a different beginning of

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,320
Hunter Hunter that Madhouse Studio

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
changed. And I'm not hating on Madhouse

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,080
Studio. They did a great job for Hunter

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
Hunter 2011. But I want to say this,

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,359
Hunter Hunter Chapter 1 also fleshes out

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,800
what Togashi had in mind all along when

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,240
it comes to the Dark Continent, when it

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
comes to who's the main character and

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,840
Jing Freaks, and when it comes to Gone

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,840
Freaks also being a main character and

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,439
how they go back and forth, which I've

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,040
been talking about for years. So, I know

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,280
you guys are really excited, but let's

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,120
talk about it. The first ever chapter in

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,040
Hunter Hunter history. Make sure you

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,800
guys don't forget to like the video and

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,960
subscribe to the channel. Now, many

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,600
people believe the Dark Continent was a

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,760
redcon after found Jing at the end of

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,760
the Hunter Hunter anime, but I beg to

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,320
differ. I actually believe Toashi was

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,680
planning this since chapter 1. The first

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,719
two pages says it all. Strange beast and

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,840
monsters, secret treasure hordes,

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,640
undiscovered wealth, mystical places and

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,439
unexplored frontiers, the mysterious

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,360
unknown. There's magic in such words for

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,520
those captivated by its spell. aka

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,760
Jing and Gon have been destined for the

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,360
dark continent since the beginning. This

35
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,200
is not really explaining our hunter to

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,960
hunter experience in the anime. It's

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,560
more so explaining our hunter to hunter

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,960
experience that's going to be coming to

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
us in the future in the dark continent.

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,119
Yes. So I don't think what we saw with

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,240
the on the world tree was a redcon. I

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,600
actually think it was planned since day

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,000
one. And I think said once found Jing

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,479
which was which was initially Kite's

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,159
goal. I do believe he already had this

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,000
set in motion and that's why I believe

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,000
Jinx will be the main character and then

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,880
Goan will come back to take over as the

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,360
main character. Yes. And I truly believe

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,960
this first page of chapter 1 is

51
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,799
describing everything I'm talking about.

52
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,920
The second page goes on to say they are

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,200
called hunters with Gon and Kite. Like

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,920
2011 Madhouse anime of Hunter Hunter is

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,240
some of the greatest adaptation of anime

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
of manga I've ever seen. Honestly, I

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,640
think it actually makes Hunter Hunter a

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,520
better series. Yes, cuz um Toashi has

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,000
some very interesting word vomit and

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,920
interesting uh artwork. But I will say

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,440
this, when it comes to storytelling,

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,760
Toashi's mind does surpass the studio.

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,120
And he wanted Kite to be a main figure

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,400
in the beginning of Hunt to Hunter where

65
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
2011 is like, "Yeah, we'll just make him

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,360
a main figure when the Chimera Anarch

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,400
starts." Which I get what they're trying

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,520
to say. They're not trying to confuse

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
readers, but I think it would have been

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,599
so cool seeing Kite again. It's like

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,319
walking dead when you saw Morgan again.

72
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,000
So, I feel like they really dropped the

73
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,760
ball there, but they have done an

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,200
amazing job, so I can't say much. So,

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,319
the beginning of the Hunter Hunter

76
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,879
chapter is gone. He catches the master

77
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,800
of the old swamp. It says, "Five grown

78
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,599
men together couldn't do what this kid

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,239
just did." And his aunt Meto, knowing

80
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,920
this, said this is the only way she was

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,920
going to let him take the Hunter exam.

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,400
Yeah, she thought it was impossible as a

83
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,200
kid, but of course, he achieved it. And

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,040
of course, he she should have known he's

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,480
the son of Jing Freaks. Of course, he's

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,640
gonna achieve this. Yes, it's even

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,200
stated that Goon has the same gleam in

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,440
his eye as Jing. And Mito is shocked

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,920
that Goon wants to be a hunter when she

90
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,760
kept his father a secret. Like honestly,

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,879
a big reason on why I believe Jing will

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,840
be a main character in the Dark

93
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,000
Continent is because of how big Jing is

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,680
in the first ever chapter. Like the lore

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,440
that Jing has in the first ever chapter

96
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,200
gives him the only right to become the

97
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,519
main character after Gone. in my

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,319
opinion. We also get a flashback 3 years

99
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,799
before Gon goes to take the Hunter exam.

100
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,159
He's saved by Kite. This was shown in

101
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,799
the beginning of the Kam anarch in the

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,879
anime of 2011. And I think it did a

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,280
shame to Kite's character. Yes, Kite was

104
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,120
still an emotional moment for Goan and

105
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
everything, but I think that his his

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,040
importance definitely was undervalued. I

107
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,920
think it should have been in episode one

108
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,840
to make us as fans really gravitate

109
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,879
towards Kite. So to talk about this

110
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,280
moment, [music] Kite kills a fox bear

111
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,239
with a cub because of course it tried to

112
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,640
kill Gone as a kid. And he says if you

113
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,879
try to kill a human like a true hunter,

114
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,799
he has to take down the animal. I think

115
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,599
this is really cool to show also how

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,280
savage the world is in a sense and how

117
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,280
people underestimate animals like

118
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,400
because we live in kind of cities and

119
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,320
areas where there's not that many

120
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,800
animals, wild animals, but wild animals

121
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,600
will [ __ ] you up, guys. And I love how

122
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,639
Kite punches Gorn for wandering around

123
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,759
Snake Beach forest this time of year. It

124
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,520
could and saying that you could have

125
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,199
been killed. And he's kind of pissed off

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,280
that he had to kill a fox bear. You

127
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
could feel Kite's anger and his passion

128
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,400
when it comes to hunting. He doesn't

129
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,919
hunt for fun. He hunts because it has to

130
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,000
be done. It's a profession and he

131
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,400
doesn't want to kill aimlessly. We even

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,680
see Kite highlighting the territorial

133
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,960
mark of a fox bear when she's with her

134
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,400
cub and mentions the lies clearing out

135
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,720
till welping season is passed. Yes, Kite

136
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,720
is showing the details of what Gohan

137
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
ignored because Kite believes he didn't

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,600
have a father in his life. He's like,

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
"Didn't your father bother teaching you

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,560
anything?" Remember, Goan had no father

141
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,919
as Jing was a deadbeat. And Kite

142
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,120
mentions the squirrel giving him a

143
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,800
warning and that's the only reason he

144
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,560
knew that something was going on. And

145
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,720
now he got a pointless kill to his

146
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,600
credit. And Gohan tells Kite he has no

147
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,360
dad or mom and lives with his aunt. And

148
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,120
Kite kind of feels guilty for being too

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,000
hard on Goan and gives him some

150
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,440
antiseptic for his injured arm, which I

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,280
found pretty interesting. Kite then

152
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,680
tells Goon he's going to put down the

153
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,680
cub as it's better a scenario than

154
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
letting it starve to death. And might

155
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,919
have some hate towards humans for seeing

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,759
his mother killed by one. But Goon wants

157
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,400
to take care of the cub, showing great

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
uh love Goon has for the baby. And

159
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,600
honestly, I think this is really good

160
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
emotional intelligence. Like he does not

161
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,440
want this young animal to be killed.

162
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Then we see Goan saying he will take

163
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,199
care of it as it's scratching at his

164
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
arm. Like honestly, he's a great kid

165
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,960
with compassion and sympathy for animals

166
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,560
and I loved it. And then Kite sees Jing

167
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,479
in Gon's eye. Remember I talked about

168
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,960
how Gon has the same gleam in his eye

169
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,280
like Jing? Yes, Kite sees it. Kite then

170
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,280
explains he's looking for Jen and pretty

171
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,600
much this is a big lead as he just found

172
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,600
one in Goon and tells Goon that Jing is

173
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,680
his teacher. He drilled the basics of

174
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,400
hunting and final challenge for Kite is

175
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,479
to find Jing. Kite also says Jing is the

176
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,319
best hunter and there's no one like him.

177
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,880
Remember Nero said Jing was a top five

178
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,840
Nen user and his ability to copy Nen as

179
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,600
a talent, not his Nen makes me believe,

180
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,440
yeah, Nzur wasn't lying. The hype is

181
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,360
real when it comes to Jing. Kite then

182
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,360
lets Goan know that Jing is alive even

183
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,680
though his aunt Mito wants to protect

184
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,680
Gohan and says all good hunters are good

185
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,720
with animals and pretty much says the

186
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,240
blood is telling when it comes to Goan

187
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
and it speaks volume when it comes to

188
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,160
potential that Goan has which is pretty

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,560
insane as we saw during the Pito versus

190
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,039
adult Goan fight how much potential he

191
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,720
truly had to avenge Kite. Also Kite

192
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,479
leaving Jing's hunter license was

193
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,240
amazing. Why didn't the anime show this

194
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,080
in the episode one? Like I still don't

195
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,160
understand. Like what a fail from a

196
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,000
great 2011 anime series which is pretty

197
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,840
much perfect. Like why not just do this

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,960
to make it even more perfect. Go then

199
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,720
tells Co, the cub of the fox bear, he's

200
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,720
going to be a hunter. And it's kind of

201
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,479
like a feel-good moment. And pretty much

202
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,720
he's I honestly would love to see Coin

203
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,400
the dog cartoonet after years during

204
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,960
Go's return with Nen. I think that'd be

205
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,759
super cool to see in a super adult

206
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,919
version of Coin the Fox bear. Then we

207
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,880
see Gohan tell the fox bear cub K hunter

208
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,479
do things animals hate and K as a king

209
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,639
of the forest can't be friends with the

210
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,479
hunter aka don't follow me. I love the

211
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,720
emotional intelligence by Goon trying to

212
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,560
tell him to stay away because he knows

213
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,039
he does he wants to do this journey by

214
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,599
himself like Goan is very mature for his

215
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,520
age. Goan also says family comes second

216
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,360
when it comes to being a hunter as Mito

217
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,960
finally admits that Jing is Goon's

218
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,840
father. That's something only Jing would

219
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,680
say. And Gorn recalls Kite who motivated

220
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,000
him to find his father Jing and follow

221
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,319
in his footsteps. The hardest challenge

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,560
that Kite said he had was to find Jing.

223
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,479
And after being a hunter, that was his

224
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,160
final test. And I think pretty much

225
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,319
growing got motivation for that goal to

226
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,840
find Jing as his main purpose. And he

227
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
found Jing at the end of the Anti Hunter

228
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,759
anime. But there's definitely a manga,

229
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,400
guys. And Dark Continent is on its way.

230
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,479
I also love how Aunt Meto admits Jing

231
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,919
never abandoned Go, but was forced to

232
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,160
give Go away. I I love that theory that

233
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,840
Goon might be a calamity like Alaka or

234
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,280
has to do with something that happened

235
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,960
in Jing's hunter alive maybe in her

236
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,800
content. I'm not too sure. As Goon says

237
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,880
he already knew because Mito never looks

238
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,279
in his eye when lying. Great emotional

239
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,279
intelligence by Gon Goon states he will

240
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,959
come back a great hunter to Meito which

241
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,399
angers the other applicants who were

242
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,919
like these guys are pretty much scrubs

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,760
but they're like yo why is this guy

244
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,040
talking so confident like does he not

245
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,800
know what he's getting himself into?

246
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,560
That's the energy I got. Then they also

247
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,120
try to give Goan a reality check saying

248
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,360
he should be happy if he even survives

249
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,240
the exam as Goan's journey begins to be

250
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,680
a hunter. Find Jing and of course we see

251
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
the captain of the ship muttering it's

252
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,440
going to be rough as he is one of the

253
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,000
examiners actually and the exams already

254
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,839
started. I think this chapter of Hunter

255
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,160
Hunter was a great start to this

256
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,760
chapter. So what are my final thoughts?

257
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,360
My final thoughts is this chapter is

258
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,120
going to be legendary till the end of

259
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,720
Hunter Hunter if we even get an ending

260
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,640
of Hunter Hunter. But they did promise

261
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,800
us 50 chapters. The reason why I say

262
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,600
it's going to be legendary is because we

263
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,920
do know some major things. Jing Freaks

264
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,080
is about to go crazy right now on this

265
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,440
trip to the dark continent and he's

266
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,279
about to be the main character.

267
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,040
Secondly, if Go comes back with his end

268
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,680
back, definitely is going to be really

269
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,839
cool to see of course him leaving again

270
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,360
the island that he was born and raised

271
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,839
and of course leaving the King of

272
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,040
Forests and going back to of course this

273
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,480
go to the dark continent. Maybe he

274
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,240
brings Killer there as well. I'm not too

275
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,720
sure. Then of course Kite. Kite is still

276
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,720
alive guys. Kite got reborn and we know

277
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,760
Kite was a major factor in the chapter

278
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,600
1. So I tr truly believe seeing a moment

279
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,600
of Jing Kite and going to the dark

280
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,560
continent would be my favorite moment in

281
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,519
Hunt onto history. And I think chapter 1

282
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,519
would definitely make me hype because of

283
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,880
all the foundation it laid out. Now I do

284
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,320
want to say this. Seeing Jing's

285
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,480
flashback is going to be think make me

286
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,000
think of chapter one too. So Jing's

287
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,160
flashback is something that I really

288
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,680
want Toashi to give us. Please, Toashi,

289
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,279
give us the secrets of Hunt. At least

290
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,880
just spoil me, yo. Like, just spoil me.

291
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,200
I know we have 50 chapters, promise, but

292
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,560
just spoil me cuz I want to know. And

293
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,640
guys, if you like videos like this where

294
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,480
I highlight and analyze chapters of

295
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,000
Huntter, I might do every single chapter

296
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,839
in Hunter Hunter, but it I'll only do

297
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,680
that if it gets 1,000 likes. If this

298
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,279
video gets 1,000 likes, it shows that

299
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,600
you Hunt Hunter fans still want me to

300
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,839
analyze the entire series up until the

301
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
50 chapters come out. But if it doesn't

302
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
get 1,000 likes, I will not do that

303
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,800
because that was a lot of work to reread

304
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,320
Hunter Hunter. I've reread it and

305
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,320
rewatched it so many times, guys.
