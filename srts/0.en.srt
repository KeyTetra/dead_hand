1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,040
There are influences in the unseen that

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,200
are dictating a lot of the way your life

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,280
goes. And these things are known as

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,519
pendulums or thought forms.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,240
They exist in a reality, like I said,

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,480
that is unseen in a frequency that is

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,720
not within the same frequency as the

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,400
physical. And so, not a lot of people

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,080
are aware of them because a lot of

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840
people think the only thing real and

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,840
what's influencing their life is the

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,719
physical. But thought forms and

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,440
pendulums are playing such a huge role

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,160
in everyone's life that it becomes of

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,200
great benefit to learn not only what

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,559
they are but how to get out of the

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,320
influence of pendulums or to select very

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,800
particular pendulums that actually

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
benefit you and serve you. And so today,

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,280
we're going to go over what pendulums

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,199
are, but more importantly, how to go

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
about selecting a pendulum that will

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,960
benefit you or to tune out completely

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,480
because it will make all of the

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,640
difference when it comes to achieving

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,400
what it is you want to achieve or just

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320
living the kind of life you would like

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,400
to create for yourself. Now, the first

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,320
thing to recognize is that pendulums are

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,240
thought forms. And not all thought forms

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,479
are necessarily pendulums, but pendulums

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
uh pendulums are kind of like um group

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,280
levels of thought. many people or many

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,439
different thoughts uh accumulated create

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,200
what's known as a pendulum. Right? A

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,720
thought form can be sometimes singular.

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,560
We're not going to get too nuanced with

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,560
this kind of thing. Uh but a pendulum

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
you can think of like a mass thought

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,280
form because a lot of thought power has

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,280
gone to a particular idea or something

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,799
else. And we'll get into exactly what

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,799
that is in just a moment. But one thing

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,720
I want to bring your attention to first

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,079
is the idea that thoughts are things.

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,799
And I know you've heard this quote

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:51,200
before. most likely that thoughts are

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,200
things and it's a very true uh saying. A

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,520
lot of us again believe because we can't

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,159
see thoughts that we can't touch them,

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,799
we can't taste them, we can't engage our

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,640
five physical senses that they are not

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,520
real and don't have much influence in

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,000
our life. But it's the exact opposite.

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,239
In fact, most of how our life goes is

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
formed by how we are thinking and what

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,879
thoughts we entertain. Remember the

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,599
quote, you get what you think about most

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,239
of the time. And thought forms are going

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,560
to play a huge role in what you're

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,959
actually going to think about. So, let's

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,440
move on to what this is. Understanding

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,440
that thoughts come in different

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,440
frequencies.

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,519
And the frequency you're at is a lot of

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,959
times going to determine which pendulum

67
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,000
or thought forms you're going to have

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,080
access to or you're influenced by.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,160
Right? Thoughts activate different

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,160
levels of frequency. If you think

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,760
certain thoughts or entertain certain

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,680
thoughts, it will put you on one

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,599
frequency and then other thoughts will

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,120
put you on different frequencies. Each

75
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,560
of these frequencies come with

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,200
corresponding effects or benefits or the

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,440
opposite of benefits depending on what

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,120
frequency you are on. So just as a

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,879
simple example, if you think more

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
negatively or allow yourself to be

81
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,080
swayed by what we could call a negative

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,319
pendulum, you will notice that you are

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,400
on a frequency that presents you with

84
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,879
more thoughts that are negative events

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,120
and circumstances that also correspond

86
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,959
with those thoughts. So understand not

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,200
all thoughts are the same. They

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,840
correspond at different levels of

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,080
frequencies and based on the frequency

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,840
or the resonance will determine what

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,879
you're receiving. Again, there are some

92
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,120
pendulums we could say are at a higher

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,640
frequency and there are some at a lower.

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,440
And then there are frequencies we can

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,120
even go to that do not contain pendulums

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
at all. We're going to go over, you

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,360
know, are pendulums good or bad and

98
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,799
everything like that. And just to kind

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
of give that away, they're not

100
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,400
necessarily good or bad. They are just

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,319
focused on survival and kind of growing

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,480
themselves. And we'll go over how that

103
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,120
actually works. You see, everything has

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,040
a thought form or a pendulum. Absolutely

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
anything you can think of has

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,519
essentially a thought form or pendulum

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,680
that a part of it, right? So any idea,

108
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,319
any kind of movement, any group, you

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,560
know, even things that seem innocuous um

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,799
you know, like um certain companies,

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,359
right? or or certain like ways of doing

112
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,840
things like sports, volleyball has a

113
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,440
thought form or a pendulum behind it.

114
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,280
You know, certain bands have thought

115
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,880
forms or pendulums behind them. Certain

116
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,440
political movements especially have

117
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
strong thought forms and pendulums

118
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,240
behind them, right? And what happens is

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,240
when you focus in on the sport, you

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,560
focus in on the political group, you

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,720
focus in on on whatever the thing is,

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,520
even certain objects like record players

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,680
for example, uh VHS sets, these are kind

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,199
of more inactive pendulums because as

125
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,720
time moves along, people take their

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,280
focus off them. They're still

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,280
technically active to a degree, but have

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,440
much less power. But when you start

129
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,360
thinking or activating the pendulum in

130
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,919
your life or accessing is a better way

131
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,080
of saying it, accessing the resonance

132
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,400
frequency of whatever the pendulum or

133
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,600
thought form is, you suddenly get kind

134
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,759
of influenced into its energy. Depending

135
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,080
on the pendulum, this can be either a

136
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,479
good or a bad thing on for you depending

137
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,039
on your goals. Some pendulums will

138
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,919
absolutely just extract your energy for

139
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,639
its own gain. Other pendulums may supply

140
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,800
you with energy again for its own gain,

141
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,800
but in this case, it also benefits you

142
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,639
and becomes a win-win. One thing to

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,280
really keep in mind when it comes to

144
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,840
pendulums is we'll go here first is

145
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,759
they're all about survival, right?

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,840
They're not really concerned about you.

147
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,759
So, when you're accessing any pendulum,

148
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,919
you have to be careful. Even ones that

149
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,520
seem good. Now there are c certainly

150
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,160
pendulums that we could observe as

151
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,160
harmless or even beneficial to you in

152
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,759
the moment. And so long as they are

153
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,479
serving you and those thought forms are

154
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,120
serving you, there is no problem in

155
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,560
accessing it, giving energy to it, and

156
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,720
it then returning whatever it's

157
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,919
returning to you. But for the vast

158
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,840
majority of pendulums, they tend to have

159
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,520
a negative um influence on people's

160
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,280
lives. This is stuff like political

161
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,680
parties. This is stuff like certain

162
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,240
movements and whatever else it is. It

163
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,280
tends to take your energy without giving

164
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,960
much in return or take your energy and

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,880
again influence your thoughts in a

166
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,280
certain direction or keep you at a

167
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,199
different resonance frequency. Now, this

168
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,520
part is very important and we'll put the

169
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,319
word resonance in there because that's a

170
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,000
very important word for us to have here

171
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,720
is that certain pendulums can only

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,639
extract your energy or or or kind of

173
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,000
feed off of you. That's essentially what

174
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,440
they're doing is they're feeding off of

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,560
your energy for survival

176
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,280
and can only do it if you are within

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,880
their resonance frequency. Meaning if

178
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,039
you're not within their resonance

179
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,360
frequency, you're beyond it. They can't

180
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,440
touch you. So for example, if you are

181
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,759
vibrating at a higher frequency or

182
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,919
consciousness, certain pendulums just

183
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,400
cannot access you because they cannot

184
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,560
survive in the environment you are

185
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,800
currently at. And again, its main goal

186
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,199
is survival and growing and kind of

187
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,199
expanding its own energy. So it's not

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,599
going to waste too much time in trying

189
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,000
to hook you if you're not within its

190
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,560
resonance frequency. it's not worth it

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,479
to the pendulum or the thought form. Um

192
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,479
I heard someone once say um a mentor

193
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,639
said um with thought forms or also known

194
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,400
as aggregors is another name for them is

195
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,560
they will try maybe about two or three

196
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,560
times to hook you into their resonance

197
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,720
frequency. And if you just don't cling

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,800
on to those thoughts, they move on.

199
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,560
Because if they stay in your energetic

200
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,479
field for too long and you are beyond

201
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
their reach and they can't get you to

202
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,479
come down, then it actually is

203
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,960
detrimental to them because you actually

204
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,120
start absorbing their energy versus them

205
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,639
being able to absorb yours. You're now

206
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,879
coming from a higher level of energy

207
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,360
that can't be touched by whatever this

208
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,520
thought form or pendulum is. And so they

209
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,199
then move on to whoever's next. And so

210
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,280
learning how to deal with pendulums and

211
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,680
thought forms also protects you from

212
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,440
harmful ones that mean to extract your

213
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,199
energy even though it gives you the

214
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,120
illusion of providing you with something

215
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,360
good. Again, a political movement is a

216
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,960
great one to focus on because a lot of

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,560
people believe that it's some some

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,560
people believe it's good to be in that

219
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,280
but a lot of times it is just a powerful

220
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,599
pendulum that is hooking people in and

221
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,680
extracting their energy for its own

222
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,080
means which is to expand to become more

223
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,279
powerful etc etc. So now going over

224
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:39,399
this, the goal again of all pendulums

225
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,399
pretty much is to access your energy.

226
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,720
This is how they survive and this is how

227
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,360
they expand their influence. Again, it's

228
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,880
almost parasitical unless you're very

229
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,399
very careful and specific about which

230
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,640
pendulums and thought forms you

231
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,160
entertain. Again, certain pendulums can

232
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,560
do a lot of good for you. But

233
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,760
understand, at the end of the day, this

234
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,880
is always their goal. Their goal is

235
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,440
always survival. Their goal is never to

236
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,920
elevate you unless it benefits them.

237
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,440
They have no heart in the sense of, oh,

238
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,360
they care for you, therefore they're

239
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,080
going to elevate you. They will only do

240
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,760
that if it also serves them to do so.

241
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,360
And so, within reality trans surfing,

242
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,120
where a lot of this comes, they'll talk

243
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,040
about how certain pendulums will have

244
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
favorites. And these favorites, they

245
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,360
actually give a lot of energy and kind

246
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,760
of elevate because it helps them as

247
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,880
well. So, always keep in mind, it's only

248
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,360
going to help you if you're helping them

249
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,519
in some way or there's some benefit to

250
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,279
this thought form or pendulum promoting

251
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,279
you or giving you energy or whatever

252
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,959
else. And so, we can think of certain

253
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,440
pendulums that would have more of a

254
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,200
positive influence that we can tune into

255
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,279
again because it's going to be a

256
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,080
win-win. But we still have to be careful

257
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,920
because as soon as it becomes a win-lose

258
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,600
in the sense that it will start

259
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,519
extracting energy and not giving back to

260
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,399
you, you want to cut ties from that

261
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,480
pendulum and get out of its resonance

262
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,440
frequency. Now remember, a pendulum

263
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,320
accesses you typically through thought

264
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,399
energy. Meaning it will try and hook you

265
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,279
and get you to a certain resonance

266
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,040
frequency via thought. And the way it

267
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,279
does this is you you have ever noticed

268
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,120
if you've had thoughts and I say you had

269
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,040
thoughts uh loosely here because it's

270
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,360
not really what's happening but certain

271
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,240
thoughts come into your mind and you

272
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,320
look at them and go I didn't think that

273
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,760
that's not me. I did not suggest that

274
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,120
thought that's not coming from me. It

275
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,200
seems to be coming from an outside

276
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,200
influence. That is most likely a

277
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,279
pendulum or thought form. If you go into

278
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,279
a room with a group of people and

279
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,279
especially let's say if the energy of

280
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,040
the room is slightly more negative and

281
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,600
you notice this happening, it is the

282
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,839
pendulum of the group or that room that

283
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,160
is trying to hook you into the energy of

284
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,399
that room so it can take your energy as

285
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,000
well and grow stronger. In a nutshell,

286
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,480
that's essentially what's happening. And

287
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,200
so you're going to have thoughts that

288
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,519
come in that try, if you're not already,

289
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,800
to get you within the resonance

290
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,760
frequency of the pendulum so it can then

291
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,920
feed or extract energy, right? And it

292
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,160
will do a lot, especially if it's got

293
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,320
you in its resonance frequency to keep

294
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,079
you there. So supplying you with

295
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
thoughts that make sense with the energy

296
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,839
you're currently in. So maybe getting

297
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,839
you to complain, oh that's unfair, this

298
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,360
person did this or that is is a

299
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,279
beautiful place for you to be for

300
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,880
certain pendulums because then it's very

301
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,240
easy to extract energy. Have you ever

302
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,240
noticed also when you're being like

303
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,760
that, let's say more of a victim level

304
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,680
consciousness, you're complaining,

305
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,399
you're moaning that you also seem to

306
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,079
feel low energy. You also seem to feel

307
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,600
drained. Maybe you haven't really done

308
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,760
much physically. There's nothing really

309
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,079
in the physical sense that should make

310
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,839
you tired, but maybe you feel tired all

311
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,920
the time when you're in these energies.

312
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,440
Yes. because your energy actually is

313
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,839
being in a sense harvested and extracted

314
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,440
by these pendulums. One analogy or

315
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,040
comparison I really love, if you've ever

316
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,200
seen the Harry Potter series, they have

317
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,160
something called um oh now I've

318
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,000
forgotten what they're called, but

319
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,920
they're the cloaked figures that kind of

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,920
suck the essence out of people and it

321
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,680
gets cold. Uh dementors, that's what

322
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,760
they're called. And I I kind of think

323
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,680
that either the author was aware of

324
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,600
pendulums or something similar and

325
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,600
brought that in or it was just some kind

326
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,760
of some kind of synchronicity that

327
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,240
happened there because they they act

328
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,959
actually very similar to how in the

329
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,800
thought realm pendulums act where they

330
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,279
kind of drain your energy. They they

331
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,440
suck your energy. They need it for their

332
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,120
survival. They you know I think in the

333
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,959
Harry Potter series dementors give you

334
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,440
all these crazy thoughts. They describe

335
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,200
it like the biggest feeling of despair.

336
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,680
you know, it's similar. It's it's more

337
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,760
Hollywood and kind of extreme because

338
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,880
this will be more subtle at times, but

339
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,560
it can be analogous to what's in that

340
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,240
book in that way. I always find that

341
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,440
very interesting that it's so close and

342
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,680
you can probably find it in other

343
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,160
stories and, you know, um fiction uh

344
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,920
similar ideas except this is a very real

345
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,680
thing. Again, thoughts are things,

346
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,760
pendulums and thought forms are real

347
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,839
things that exist. Uh they're not just

348
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,560
ideas. They exist within a certain realm

349
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,880
and they have a modus operandi. They're

350
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,200
trying to again survive like anything is

351
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,399
trying to do by extracting your energy.

352
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
Again, they do this through thought

353
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,360
trying to do that and they do this

354
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,720
through your attention. And this is a

355
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,040
very important part of it because you

356
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,000
might think, "Oh, I won't succumb to

357
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,000
this pendulum of this political party. I

358
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,760
will do the opposite." Well, you're

359
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,320
still actually giving it energy. A

360
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,720
pendulum again is not a moral character.

361
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,680
It does not care in which way you give

362
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,720
it attention. It need only require your

363
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,040
attention to take your energy or to

364
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,600
start influencing your life. And so one

365
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,480
of the solutions to removing certain

366
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,519
pendulums from our lives is to literally

367
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,279
turn our back to the pendulum. When the

368
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,880
thoughts come up, we just ignore them

369
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,040
and let them pass by. The suggestions

370
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,040
that try to hook you. When it tries to

371
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,560
get you to fight it in the sense of,

372
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,720
"Oh, you hate me. You don't want me, you

373
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,120
hate me. So why not fight me? Why not do

374
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,040
the opposite?" we just do not engage

375
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,600
because what it's trying to do is hook

376
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,800
you through opposition to it. So, you

377
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,800
know, whether it's Republican to

378
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,720
Democrat, Democrat to Republican, or you

379
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,480
know, this idea, you know, veganism to

380
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,880
carnivore, carnivore to veganism,

381
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,680
whatever it is, it's causing the battle,

382
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,240
but keeps actually those two groups in a

383
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,639
similar place of being able to harvest

384
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,720
their energy. And so the way we avoid

385
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,560
this with negative pendulums that would

386
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,120
influence you in this way that you don't

387
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,880
want is we simply turn our backs to them

388
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,720
and we do not give them our attention

389
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,360
while focusing our attention to

390
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,720
frequencies that actually benefit us.

391
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,639
Okay. So now we're going to go over some

392
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,360
of the main ways a pendulum tries to

393
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,440
hook or control you so you'll be more

394
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,279
aware of when this is going on. You may

395
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,360
find as we go through this that you're

396
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,040
already have these influences in your

397
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,519
life. And then we're going to go over

398
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,440
what you can do to defeat a pendulum.

399
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,079
And then we will also go over when you

400
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,760
should ride or allow a pendulum to take

401
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,959
you because it will be beneficial.

402
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,880
Right? So we'll have basically

403
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,639
everything involved here. Now, here are

404
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,800
some of the main ways in which a

405
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,199
pendulum, you know, is trying to control

406
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,480
you or perhaps is. The first thing is

407
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,560
they're going to do is they're going to

408
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,240
try and provoke you in some kind of way.

409
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,760
Again, this could be through thought.

410
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,760
This could even be through something

411
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,360
outside of you happening to you, someone

412
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,040
saying something to you. you know,

413
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,320
they'll absolutely use other people

414
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,000
within kind of their influence to do

415
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,399
this to you and get you into the

416
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
resonance they need you to be in or to

417
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,760
keep you in the resonance they need you

418
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,120
to be in. For example, again, with

419
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,199
political parties, you can see this

420
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,279
playing out because the pendulum doesn't

421
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,360
care which side of the aisle you're on.

422
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,360
It loves that they fight each other

423
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,079
because that's a way of provoking that

424
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,639
keeps everyone within its control, being

425
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,720
able to extract the energy. The next

426
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,760
thing is trying to make you feel either

427
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,759
right or wrong. A huge ego game. Trying

428
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,079
to get one up on someone else. You know,

429
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,240
spiritual oneupsmanship or anything

430
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,839
else. I'm right. You're wrong. Or the

431
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
other way going, "Nah, I'm wrong. You

432
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,279
know, I'm always wrong." Right? On the

433
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,360
other end of the spectrum, it will love

434
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,519
to use this one because it feeds into

435
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,279
our ego, which keeps us in lower

436
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,000
conscious states, which makes us

437
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,920
accessible for energy extraction. The

438
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,680
next is drama, which is another obvious

439
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,519
one. anything that's dramatic. You'll

440
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,680
notice maybe people around you getting

441
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,600
involved in drama, in gossip, in this

442
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,279
kind of stuff. Another favorite of the

443
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,519
pendulum because it keeps you right

444
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,920
within that range of their frequency to

445
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,000
just continually take your energy. Drama

446
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,720
is a huge one. The next is always

447
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,199
needing to be in arguments or fights or

448
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,759
online. Fighting and arguing with people

449
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,079
absolutely put you into their resonance

450
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,560
frequency. Again, it doesn't care what

451
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,600
side of the aisle you're on. only cares

452
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,800
that you're giving it attention. Um, and

453
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,800
especially if you're doing it

454
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,800
emotionally, it gives it more energy to

455
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,399
feed off of. Remember, emotion is energy

456
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,079
in motion. When you're angry and

457
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,639
frustrated, you're giving off more

458
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,320
energy. It absolutely laps that up. And

459
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,399
so, we'll keep you in that. Which brings

460
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,040
us to defend or attack, which is kind of

461
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,360
the same thing. Both require quite a bit

462
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,120
of energy. Both feed it quite a bit of

463
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,640
energy. So, it'll try and put you in

464
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,799
that place, show you things that it

465
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,439
thinks you'll attack or want to defend

466
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,679
against. and get you into that zone

467
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,520
again through urgency or fear. If you

468
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,439
ever find you're rushing, you're in this

469
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,120
urgent state, it feels like life or

470
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,720
death, even though after you know it's

471
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,959
not going to feel that way, this is

472
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,880
usually a pendulum trying to get you,

473
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,319
control you, or keep you within its

474
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,799
resonance. Fear is one of its favorite

475
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,120
um places to put people because it's

476
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,280
just one of the just easiest things to

477
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,200
put people on the planet. Again, fear

478
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,039
and pride, right and wrong would be with

479
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,520
pride, arguments, defend or attack,

480
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,280
usually with pride, obviously fear being

481
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,320
different. But ultimately understand

482
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,120
it's trying to keep you in low levels of

483
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,799
consciousness, low levels of frequency.

484
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,400
As you start going up the consciousness

485
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,320
scale, if you're aware of the Hawking

486
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,960
scale of consciousness, once you start

487
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,919
to get to level 200 and above, you start

488
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,919
to get out of the range of negative

489
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,320
pendulums and thought forms. And it

490
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,640
actually becomes a risk for those

491
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,480
pendulums to try and hook you or get you

492
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,480
because they then have to go into an

493
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,320
environment that doesn't support their

494
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,200
energy. and they can start losing

495
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,120
influence and energy if they stay in

496
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,080
that environment too long, which is what

497
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,520
we ultimately want to do, right? So, if

498
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,200
we're in low consciousness, we are

499
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,720
susceptible. When we raise our

500
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,480
frequency, we're not. And that's going

501
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,120
to be a part of the solutions is don't

502
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,280
try and get hooked into it or argue with

503
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,200
it or whatever else. Just aim to raise

504
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,360
your frequency and consciousness and you

505
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,200
will be out of the way or range of

506
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,520
influence by these pendulums. And the

507
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,440
other ones are news, content, conflict,

508
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,280
especially addiction to these things. If

509
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,000
you find you are addicted to the news,

510
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,600
addicted to content. So scrolling on the

511
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,160
internet, scrolling on Instagram. Again,

512
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,080
a lot of this is um if I can get this

513
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,360
pen off,

514
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,160
a lot of this usually calibrates at

515
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,960
drama or it calibrates at fear, even

516
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,120
urgency, right? These contents usually

517
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,200
are at this level of consciousness.

518
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,200
Again, you can ride good pendulums in a

519
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,200
higher level of consciousness, but if

520
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,919
you find that whatever you're being

521
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,799
influenced by is drama- based, it's

522
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,720
trying to provoke you into a reaction,

523
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,960
it's trying to put you in fear or low

524
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,120
consciousness, again, this is one of the

525
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,200
ways in which pendulums will go to

526
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,440
control you. Again, conflict being the

527
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,039
other. So, another one of I just put it

528
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,200
over here in big letters because this is

529
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,440
a big one. One of the favorite tools of

530
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,799
the pendulum is something called um

531
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,440
excessive potential or importance. They

532
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,440
will try and make you create all of this

533
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,919
importance around something. We can also

534
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,120
think of this as pedestalization. And if

535
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,880
you're trying to create things in your

536
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,559
life, there is nothing that will push

537
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,120
further away from you what it is you

538
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,679
want than raising importance. And this

539
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,559
is another favorite of the pendulum to

540
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,880
get you into its resonance frequency and

541
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,480
extract and harvest your energy. So,

542
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,559
when you're putting this inflated

543
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,080
importance on something in your life,

544
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,840
one of the first things you want to do

545
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,080
is something we're about to go over,

546
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,960
lower the importance. So, how do you

547
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,919
defeat a pendulum? Again, a pendulum

548
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,480
can't control you necessarily in the

549
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,480
sense of it can make you do exactly what

550
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,559
it wants you to do. It tries to

551
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,720
influence you, but at the end of the

552
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,559
day, you are the creator and you are way

553
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,440
more powerful than the pendulum. What

554
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,919
the pendulum aims to do is influence and

555
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,159
manipulate manipulate you in a way to

556
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,840
get you in range and then extract your

557
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,320
energy because you're very powerful. It

558
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,640
wants your energy, but can only do it if

559
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,000
it succeeds in manipulating you. If it

560
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,200
was more powerful than you, it would

561
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,039
just overwhelm you. It wouldn't need

562
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,640
your permission. It wouldn't need you to

563
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,240
basically disempower yourself. It would

564
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,400
just take your energy hook, line, and

565
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,159
sinker. That's not the way it is. You

566
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,640
can raise your energy because you're a

567
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,520
powerful being well beyond the influence

568
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,679
of a pendulum. A pendulum is only as

569
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,320
strong as the people it can bring into

570
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,480
its structure. And again, you are more

571
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,080
powerful than that structure. If those

572
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,520
people are removed, if those thoughts,

573
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,600
that energy that's being extracted is

574
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,480
removed. The pendulum falls and dies. It

575
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,720
stops. It can't keep going. It sway and

576
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,320
swing no longer as influential. Again,

577
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,400
we talked about some old pendulums, some

578
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,919
innocuous ones. But you can also look at

579
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,840
certain political movements that are no

580
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,440
more. Those pendulums are now

581
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,600
essentially dead. We can look at things

582
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,960
like again record players, VHS's might

583
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,600
be a certain sway. Those are more

584
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,520
innocuous for the most part. Um but

585
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,240
again the influence is gone. They have

586
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,080
no power because the power of the people

587
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,919
who use these things and thought about

588
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,840
these things is no longer there. So

589
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,080
moving on to what we can do. The first

590
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,280
one is we already mentioned but it's

591
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,280
don't react. That's the first one. When

592
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,200
it tries to provoke you, when it tries

593
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,559
to get you to argue and do all these

594
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,799
things, try not to react. Don't get

595
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,440
hooked in. Now, if you do react, then

596
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,840
best next thing to do is to take a step

597
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,520
back and get yourself out of the

598
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,080
reaction. So, let's say you react

599
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,480
immediately and you realize you reacted.

600
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Wake up and take a step back. Get out of

601
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,080
the energy of the reaction because right

602
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,400
now you're quite literally being

603
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,480
harvested. You are having your energy

604
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,640
extracted and it's trying to get you to

605
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,720
spiral to be able to take your energy

606
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,480
for a longer period of time. You ever

607
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,559
notice when you do react that it can

608
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,360
sometimes dictate your whole day if you

609
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,679
allow it? Yeah. Because it is a pendulum

610
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,559
trying to keep that going to continually

611
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,520
have you in its frequency so it can take

612
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,039
your energy. So the first thing is don't

613
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,760
react. We already mentioned this next

614
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,480
one which is lower

615
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,880
importance.

616
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,480
Elevated importance is a pendulum's one

617
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,320
of its favorite tools or a thought

618
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,520
form's favorite tool to make you put

619
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,600
importance in all these things.

620
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,840
importance on money, importance on

621
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,360
health, importance on relationships. And

622
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,799
again, we have been convinced to believe

623
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,840
that the more importance we put on

624
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,520
something, again, because of the

625
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,679
influence of a pendulum, this is a

626
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,280
thought that is propagated by them, that

627
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,280
if we put more importance on something,

628
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,880
we're more likely to get it. Well, how's

629
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,720
that been working out? The more

630
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,400
important you put on something, the more

631
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
you push it away. So, if you're

632
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,760
desperate for more money, you usually

633
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,960
end up not having as much. If you're

634
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,880
desperate for a certain kind of

635
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,400
relationship, you usually don't get it.

636
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,840
kind of like being needy in a

637
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,760
relationship and it kind of repelling

638
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,200
the other person. Um, so long as

639
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,520
everything's healthy in that in that

640
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,720
situation, right? And so the way to

641
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,640
counter this is always lower the

642
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,000
importance. You can say something for

643
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,480
example, you know, everything is going

644
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
to work out in my favor um even if I

645
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,799
don't know how. Right? That takes away

646
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,240
the control element of needing it to

647
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,840
happen in a certain way. And the

648
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,440
pendulum is going to try and convince

649
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,880
you that it has to happen in a certain

650
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,360
way. You need to control this and

651
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,360
control that. when in reality we just

652
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,080
need to lower the importance. A great

653
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,080
quote is when you lower the importance a

654
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,600
solution will present itself because

655
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,159
when you lower the importance your

656
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,760
frequency automatically rises because

657
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,600
you're no longer in fear. You're no

658
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
longer in apathy. You're no longer in

659
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,240
drama because you don't need things to

660
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,640
happen in a certain way. So you move

661
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,720
beyond that. You move into typically at

662
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,240
least willingness and acceptance which

663
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,919
are high levels of consciousness. And

664
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,159
you can use that as a springboard to go

665
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,279
higher which will actually allow for

666
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,520
favorable results to happen. So we need

667
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,159
to lower the importance. The next is to

668
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,200
be the observer and to remind yourself

669
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,760
to do this often.

670
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,799
This is going to help you to not react

671
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,480
and also lower the importance. It's also

672
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,960
going to help you with the next one as

673
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,360
well. But you want to move more into the

674
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,240
role of the observer. Don't be a

675
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,840
participant yet. be an observer who then

676
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,679
will choose what they wish to

677
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,679
participate in after they've kind of

678
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,960
seen the lay of the land. Right? So

679
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,640
instead of just getting hooked and

680
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,559
hooked and hooked and react, react,

681
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,039
react, you take a step back and here's

682
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,039
this thought that's coming in. Okay,

683
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,520
here's a thought. It's just a thought.

684
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,360
So it's nothing yet, but is it something

685
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,200
that serves me or is it something that's

686
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,720
trying to extract from me? And you see

687
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,960
this thought that's trying to provoke

688
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,200
you drama- based arguments or whatever

689
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,799
else. And now that you're the observer,

690
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,400
you see that it's separate from you. You

691
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,159
see, one thing the pendulum will try and

692
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,320
do is it will try and get you to

693
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,000
identify with the thought. So you think

694
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,600
it's you. You think this thought is

695
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,120
coming from you. You think you are the

696
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,120
thought. And then hook, line, and

697
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,960
sinker. You're in one of these. And the

698
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,640
pendulum has you in its resonance

699
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,080
frequency. But when you're the observer,

700
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,159
you're the one watching the thought.

701
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,919
Therefore, you can't be the thought. You

702
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,240
are not the thought. It is just a

703
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,080
thought. You are someone experiencing a

704
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,840
thought or it is coming to your

705
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,919
awareness and attention and you

706
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,480
recognize as the observer you get to

707
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,640
make a choice in what relationship you

708
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,799
would like to have with this thought or

709
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,120
idea or energy or whatever is coming up.

710
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,799
This works for emotions as well. You're

711
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,120
the observer and you now get to make a

712
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,960
choice. And so you can now choose this

713
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,880
is something I will take on or this is

714
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,480
something I will allow to pass by. It

715
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,159
won't get hooked. And remember, with

716
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,840
pendulums or thought forms, it will try

717
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,159
two or three times to get you into its

718
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,600
resonance frequency. And if it can't,

719
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,559
because you're you're at a higher

720
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,240
frequency, it will move on because it is

721
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,799
at risk. Remember, it's self-centered.

722
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,840
It is at risk by continuing to try and

723
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,360
hook you. So, it's not going to take

724
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,120
that risk. Right? If you're in an

725
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,039
elevated frequency, it will try maybe a

726
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,200
couple times, but if it can't get you,

727
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,279
it will move on. Right? So, the next

728
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,440
thing is to redirect your focus. So,

729
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:21,200
you've been the observer.

730
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,200
You've observed. Now you want to choose

731
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,200
differently.

732
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,000
I did not give myself enough space

733
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,559
there. So there you go. So now you

734
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,320
redirect your focus. So you have

735
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,559
observed, you've not reacted, you've

736
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,919
lowered the importance. Now you still

737
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,159
want to make a choice. You are a

738
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,640
creator. You are making choices. Now you

739
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,960
can choose either to use a thought to

740
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,440
get onto a pendulum that benefits you or

741
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,120
just to choose how what direction you

742
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,400
want to go in. Right? So this thought

743
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,760
comes up. this thought comes up. And

744
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,600
what's great about these thoughts when

745
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,400
you're not reacting is you can look at

746
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,240
them and through contrast be better

747
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,440
directed in which way you want to go.

748
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,320
And what I mean is let's say you have a

749
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
thought and you're like, "No, I don't

750
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,840
want to do that. No, I don't want to do

751
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,559
that." It brings up the question, well,

752
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,120
what do you want to do? And those other

753
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,360
thoughts actually help to birth what it

754
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,520
is you do want. And then you can move in

755
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,679
that direction and focus by choosing

756
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,919
differently what you want. Notice this

757
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,520
isn't change something. It's not trying

758
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,000
to change the thought because then the

759
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,520
egregor or the pendulum's won because

760
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,600
you're now wrestling with the thought.

761
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,200
You're trying to change it. Again, it's

762
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,960
like having a captain at the ship of

763
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
your vessel that's moving in a certain

764
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,799
direction and you try and change a

765
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,120
negative captain. The captain's not

766
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,600
going to change. But if you choose a new

767
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,200
captain that goes in place that just is

768
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,120
going in that direction, well then

769
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,520
suddenly you'll be off to the races

770
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,760
moving where you want to go. So you

771
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,480
always want to choose differently and

772
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,400
redirect your focus. And so I would keep

773
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,640
in mind all of these and the ways they

774
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,799
try to hook you and then remembering all

775
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,279
of these to defeat it. You notice it's

776
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,120
not that complicated to defeat one. Why

777
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,120
is it not complicated? Why is it not

778
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,760
hard when you get this? Because you are

779
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,679
infinitely more powerful than a

780
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,679
pendulum. You are infinitely more

781
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,320
powerful than an agregore or thought

782
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,240
form. But this doesn't mean to then, you

783
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,000
know, go off and not be aware of them.

784
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,080
be aware so you know if they're trying

785
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,559
to hook you. And then bring yourself

786
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,960
back into your power, your ability to be

787
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,799
the observer and creator again. This is

788
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,799
observation. This is creation.

789
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,360
Excuse my terrible writing here. This is

790
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,080
observation. This is creation. And these

791
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,320
two help you to move back into what you

792
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,080
truly are, which is the observer and

793
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,200
creator. Right? So this allows you to

794
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,120
observe because you're being the

795
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,080
observer. And then this allows you to

796
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,679
create based on your observation. You've

797
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,000
observed, you've seen the actual lay of

798
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,080
the land. Now with that information and

799
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,640
data, you step into your power as a

800
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,640
creator and choose the direction you

801
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,279
want to go. Okay. So now we need to talk

802
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,880
briefly about the conditions where you

803
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,200
can ride a pendulum and actually

804
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,120
benefit. Now, this could be for almost

805
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,880
any pendulum, although we want ones that

806
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,240
more of a positive frequency, but

807
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,880
depending on how you interact with it

808
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,039
and what it gives you, um, you can

809
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,120
safely ride a pendulum. We'll go over

810
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,120
what that is and also some pitfalls to

811
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,679
watch out for. Basically, the pitfalls

812
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,880
are from that last screen. If any of

813
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,080
that's happening, like it's trying to

814
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,679
hook you, it's trying to get you into

815
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,200
drama. If any of that's happening and

816
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,760
you're succumbing to it, then you want

817
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,120
to stop riding this pendulum. But in a

818
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,279
lot of cases, it can be hugely

819
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,039
beneficial. For example, um let's say

820
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,520
you know a certain meditation technique

821
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,520
is a pendulum, right? And let's say you

822
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,799
are joyfully riding that pendulum. It's

823
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,799
providing you energy and everything

824
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,640
else. Then that's a beneficial thing.

825
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,480
But let's say then you get incredibly

826
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,159
serious and rigid and almost in your

827
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,840
head about it. Then you're suddenly

828
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,600
feeding just the pendulum without

829
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,600
gaining anything in return. Right?

830
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,360
You've raised the importance. You've

831
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,080
created drama around it. And so even

832
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,120
though the idea is seen as a really good

833
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,320
one in a vacuum, you've now succumbed to

834
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,320
a frequency uh with that pendulum where

835
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,399
it's actually just extracting energy

836
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,080
from you and it ceases to become

837
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,600
beneficial. So understand there might be

838
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,200
things you go oh this is good in a

839
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,000
nutshell but there are people for

840
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,640
example who align with certain spiritual

841
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,960
say modalities that can be really good

842
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,200
but become for example very prideful

843
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,120
about it. They become very right versus

844
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,399
wrong about it. And that's when it can

845
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,799
take a dangerous toll. So don't just

846
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,880
look at it at face value or appearances.

847
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,799
Look at how it's making you feel and

848
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,840
everything else. So one thing is if it

849
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,679
aligns to you is something that you can

850
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,840
ride and go with. So for example, the

851
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,480
pendulum of meditation, the pendulum of

852
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,480
certain spiritual ideas, right? Those

853
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,679
still exist. And if they align to you,

854
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,919
which means they're going to energize

855
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,919
and uplift you, that's a perfectly good

856
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,440
pendulum to follow and allow to ride

857
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,520
along because you're going to gain

858
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,919
energy from it. Essentially, any that's

859
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,320
going to give you good energy is a good

860
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,159
one to align with. The next thing is it

861
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,919
doesn't drain you. If you ever notice a

862
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,679
pendulum is draining you, you either

863
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,279
need to reconstruct your relationship

864
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,039
with it because you might be raising

865
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,000
importance or doing all this other stuff

866
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,080
or it's time to completely just release

867
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,679
that relationship to this pendulum

868
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,080
because it's getting to a point where

869
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,000
it's not benefiting you. Right? So, if

870
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,000
it's draining you, that's something you

871
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,919
need to also be aware of. And the next

872
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,480
thing is don't be attached to its

873
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,080
outcomes. Maybe certain things within

874
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,159
the pendulum have certain outcomes

875
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,840
they're going for and you need to make

876
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,600
sure you are not attached to these

877
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,679
raising importance through these or

878
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,919
again now being susceptible to having

879
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,559
your energy drained in order to support

880
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,399
its outcome. Remember this is about your

881
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,799
journey and what you came here to

882
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,880
create. If you get sucked into a

883
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,640
movement that has a particular outcome,

884
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,320
unless it is completely aligned and

885
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,399
therefore gives you joy, you're going to

886
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,159
be in for a rough ride. And a lot of

887
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,000
people get seduced into that thinking,

888
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,399
"Oh, that's the outcome I want, but it's

889
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,640
really just being the influence of the

890
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,240
pendulum." Again, if it feels draining,

891
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,559
if it puts you in low consciousness, if

892
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,519
it does not uplift and align, then it

893
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,279
isn't your true dharma or journey or

894
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,679
whatever we're calling it. But again, if

895
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,000
this is fulfilled, then you can ride the

896
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:09,039
pendulum and gain energy via or through

897
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,600
it. Just recognize that no pendulum is

898
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,000
looking to necessarily support you

899
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,000
without benefit to itself. Don't look at

900
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,480
it from a moral standpoint. These are

901
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,519
just thought forms that have one mission

902
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,279
essentially, and that is to survive and

903
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,320
thrive energetically by having more

904
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,080
adherence um and gaining more energy

905
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,679
through them. So, they don't care how

906
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,080
they do it. They don't care if also you

907
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,000
benefit or you don't. But they, you

908
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,600
know, for example, if if this if you

909
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,159
died, they wouldn't care. Let's just say

910
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,600
it that way, right? So make sure this

911
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,919
criteria is fit if you're going to

912
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,559
follow one. Now again, this could be you

913
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,480
joining a movement joyfully without

914
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,799
identification, right? So you actually

915
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,480
gain a lot by being in whatever movement

916
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,559
or whatever the thing is. You get joy

917
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,559
out of it. It aligns, it uplifts, it

918
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,159
doesn't drain you. But the moment you

919
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,559
start becoming emotional, serious,

920
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,240
rigid, um understand that you're now

921
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,320
feeding the pendulum and moving away

922
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,080
from your purpose with whatever that is,

923
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,240
it is no longer benefiting you and now

924
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,159
it's extracting your energy instead of

925
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,320
uplifting you. Essentially, the easiest

926
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,480
litmus test is when you are with a

927
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,159
pendulum, is it uplifting you and

928
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,840
causing your energy to raise? Does it

929
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,679
seem like you have more energy to work

930
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,600
with? And again, things at higher levels

931
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,559
of consciousness will typically have

932
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,159
this effect more. or does it feel like

933
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,799
it's draining you? Does it feel like

934
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,120
it's just using your energy? Do you feel

935
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,760
that it's just leaving you depleted?

936
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,919
Then that is one you most likely want to

937
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,000
just distance yourself from. And again,

938
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,799
using the steps we had in the last

939
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,120
screen to get out of its resonance

940
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,440
frequency. Now, this is some great

941
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,440
stuff. And if you want to really learn

942
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,360
how to do this at a high level, you can

943
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,399
check out mold your reality down below.

944
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,320
It's going to show you how to do this

945
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,480
quickly and so much more. We're getting

946
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,919
amazing results coming through that

947
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,679
program which will be on screen right

948
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,200
now as I'm talking. I've made it very

949
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,799
affordable. You get two coaching calls a

950
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,799
week and so much more. You can learn

951
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,399
more through the link below. Or if you

952
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,240
want to work with me on an even closer,

953
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,200
more kind of one-on-one small groupoup

954
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,440
basis, I have that down below as well.

955
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,839
Now, this next video over here is also

956
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,560
going to help you to wire this in even

957
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,480
more and benefit even more what you've

958
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,800
learned today. So you are creating now

959
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,399
with the awareness of pendulums, making

960
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,720
sure you don't get sucked into their

961
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:26,000
frequency and also being able to use

962
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,000
them to your benefit.
