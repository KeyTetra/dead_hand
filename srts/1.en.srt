1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,520
The night before being captured, Jesus

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,960
convened his close circle in an upper

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,200
apartment in Jerusalem. Peter, John, and

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,519
Mary Magdalene. They could sense

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,920
something dreadful approaching. The

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,240
atmosphere was dense with tension.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,640
They'd been praying for hours, begging

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,199
God to protect their instructor and halt

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,119
what was coming. Jesus looked at them

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,160
with a mix of compassion and

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,160
frustration. He remarked, "You're still

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,559
praying like children to a distant

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,600
father for help. I have shown you

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,239
miracles. I've taught you the mysteries,

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,040
yet you still don't understand. You do

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,680
not need to pray. You need to call."

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,280
Peter did not understand. What is the

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,920
difference? Jesus leaned forward. Prayer

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,719
involves requesting. Calling means

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,640
declaring. When you pray, you are

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,680
communicating to something apart from

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,920
yourself, somebody far away who may or

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,920
may not hear you. When you call the

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,799
monad, you are not requesting

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,360
permission. You are activating what is

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,880
already within you. You are speaking as

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,840
the monad, not to the monad and archons.

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,119
Prayers can be intercepted. They feed on

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,360
the energy of pleading and alienation.

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,520
However, they cannot touch a call

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,320
because it runs at a frequency they

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,640
cannot perceive. That teaching did not

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,360
make it into the Bible. The church

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,280
deleted any references to the Manet call

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,799
from canonical scripture because if

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,360
Christians understood they could

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,520
altogether avoid prayer, the entire

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,159
religious power system would crumble

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,560
overnight. But the Gnostics kept it

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,680
veiled in literature. The church

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,920
attempted to burn. And tonight you will

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,119
receive what Jesus taught the chosen

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,920
ones in that upper room 2,000 years ago.

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,320
Not a prayer. The manad refers to the

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,960
procedure that archons fear more than

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,960
any ceremony they could ever do. If

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,680
you're calling the monad tonight, leave

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,320
a remark. I'm phoning the monet right

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,399
now. Before I give you the actual words

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,800
that Jesus taught, you need to

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,959
understand why prayer does not operate

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,200
as you were told it did. Most

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,520
individuals are taught that prayer is

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,120
how they speak with God. You bowed your

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,080
head. You express your needs, anxieties,

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,239
and wishes. And somewhere in the sky,

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,760
God listens and determines whether to

58
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,280
respond. Perhaps he says yes. Perhaps he

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,280
says no. Maybe he says to wait. And you

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,519
embrace that framework because you've

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,680
been taught it since you were a child.

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,000
But here's what happens when you pray as

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,120
the church taught you to pray. Your

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,280
remarks do not go directly to the monad.

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,760
They can't because the religious system

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,879
was constructed with multiple levels of

67
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,280
mediators. You pray to Jesus who

68
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,400
intercedes with the father. You pray to

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,959
Mary who intercedes with Jesus or you

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,360
pray to saints who intervene with higher

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,159
angels who may finally carry your

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,120
request up the hierarchy. Each layer is

73
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,599
a filter. Every layer represents a point

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,480
at which your prayer can be intercepted,

75
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,280
misdirected or drained of energy before

76
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,080
it reaches the source. And who controls

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,720
those layers? Who benefits from the

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,840
hierarchical structure? The archons

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,840
built it, not the monet. The archons

80
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,239
established religion systems through

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,120
intermediaries because they gain access

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,480
to your energy. Every time you pray out

83
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,120
of need, fear, or despair, you are

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,920
sending a separation frequency. You're

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,959
declaring yourself impotent, independent

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,599
from God, and relying on external powers

87
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,319
to help you if you beg appropriately.

88
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,879
And that frequency is what archons feed

89
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,280
on. They don't mind if you receive what

90
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,760
you prayed for. They've already gotten

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,319
what they wanted. your energy, your

92
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,439
surrender, your conviction that you are

93
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,720
distinct from divine power. Jesus was

94
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,360
aware of this. He watched it happen. He

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,080
seen individuals praying for hours,

96
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,879
days, and even lifetimes without

97
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,359
receiving what they desired. Not because

98
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,440
God didn't care. Instead, their

99
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,840
petitions were intercepted before they

100
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,560
reached the monad. So, he taught the

101
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,040
chosen ones something else. He advised

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,040
them to stop praying and start calling

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,560
because calling eliminates all

104
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,199
intermediaries.

105
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,759
It does not go through layers. It does

106
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,120
not pass through angels, saints or

107
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,759
hierarchies. It is a direct line. You

108
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,400
source an unfiltered intercepted

109
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,960
instant. The distinction between prayer

110
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,400
and calling is analogous to that between

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,880
asking and demanding. When you pray, you

112
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,199
are in the victim frequency. You're

113
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,600
asking someone more powerful than you to

114
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,440
assist you if they feel like it. When

115
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,720
you summon the minute of sovereign

116
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,080
frequency, you are not asking. You are

117
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,720
declaring. You are speaking as the monad

118
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,759
which recognizes itself in transient

119
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,400
human form. Because the monad does not

120
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,840
respond to begging. This frequency shift

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,320
has a significant impact. It responds to

122
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,560
recognition. Here's why the church

123
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,400
discontinued this doctrine. If

124
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,639
Christians understood they could contact

125
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,199
the monad directly, that they didn't

126
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,680
need priests to verify sacraments or

127
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,320
institutional approval to access divine

128
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,479
power, why would they need the church?

129
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,280
The entire system is based on you

130
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,919
believing you are apart from God. You

131
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,479
need intermediates. That you two have

132
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,440
become so sinful that humanity cannot

133
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,160
approach the source directly. But Jesus

134
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,720
taught the contrary. He taught that you

135
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,360
are source awareness manifesting in a

136
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,840
transitory body. And the moment you see

137
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
this, the moment you stop praying like a

138
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,240
servant and begin calling like the

139
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,400
divine being you truly are, everything

140
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,360
the church has established to regulate

141
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,919
your spiritual access becomes useless.

142
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,919
That is why they burnt the documents.

143
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,080
That is why they assassinated the

144
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,880
Gnostic teachers who recognized the

145
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,280
monad call. That is why this technique

146
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,240
has been deliberately removed from all

147
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,880
accepted Christian texts. Not because it

148
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,919
was heretical but because it was highly

149
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,400
effective. Now I'll tell you what Jesus

150
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,280
taught in that upper room. The precise

151
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,080
structure of the monad call. It consists

152
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,120
of three components. Each one is

153
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,000
crucial. Remove any peace and you can

154
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,800
resume your prayers. However, when all

155
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,280
three are said simultaneously, a direct

156
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,840
connection is established that archons

157
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,720
cannot intercept or control within the

158
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,360
church. The first component is an

159
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,000
identification declaration. You aren't

160
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,720
begging God for aid. You're expressing

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,080
who you are. This is the basis. Since

162
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,960
the moned does not react to separation,

163
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,440
it reacts to recognition. When you talk,

164
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,039
you have to speak from knowledge, not

165
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,160
hoping.

166
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,800
I'm attempting to connect with God.

167
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,520
I'm a sinner looking for grace. You

168
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,560
speak from the truth. You are monatic

169
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,599
awareness in transient form. You are not

170
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,560
separated. You never were. And the words

171
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,440
you say must carry that frequency. The

172
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,080
second component is attention control.

173
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,440
This is not courteous. This is not

174
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,680
humble supplication. You aren't asking

175
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,479
the monad to listen if it's not too

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,639
busy. You are commanding attention

177
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,680
because you are not addressing something

178
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,720
external. You are speaking as the monad

179
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,479
to itself. When the monad recognizes

180
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:58,240
itself, attentiveness is automatic. It

181
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,479
is not arrogance. It is recognition. You

182
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,639
are alerting source consciousness to the

183
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,919
knowledge that one of its fragments is

184
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,000
calling. That call cannot be ignored.

185
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,479
The final component is direct

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,120
manifestation. You don't state whether

187
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,759
it's your will. Please assist me or I

188
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,319
hope this works. You declare what is

189
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,039
manifesting in the present tense.

190
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,440
Absolute assurance. Because the quantum

191
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,479
realm does not respond to hope. It

192
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,280
responds to frequency. namely the

193
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,759
frequency of assurance, knowing, and

194
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,200
declaratory power. That's what

195
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,240
transforms possibility into reality. You

196
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,240
may not be asking the cosmos to change.

197
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,519
You state that the transition is

198
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,320
underway now. Jesus blended these three

199
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,279
elements into a framework so simple that

200
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,800
most people underestimate its potency.

201
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,680
Three statements, nine words, one

202
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,279
unbreakable bond. The maned call he

203
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,640
taught is I am manad. Hear me manifest

204
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,200
now. That is it. Three declarations will

205
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,800
transform your frequency from separation

206
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,440
to unity, from begging to command, from

207
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,920
prayer to power. And the instant you say

208
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,640
these words with knowledge, with an

209
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,519
understanding of what they imply, the

210
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,240
direct line opens instantly rather than

211
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,600
eventually. Let me explain what each

212
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,320
statement accomplishes. I am on it. This

213
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,880
is recognition. You are not implying

214
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,440
that I am attempting to emulate God or

215
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,240
that I am connected to something bigger.

216
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,200
You are declaring the truth. You are

217
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,240
monad awareness manifested in human

218
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,440
form. Every fragment of a source is a

219
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,800
source. You are not distinct. You are

220
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,760
not less than. You are the infinite

221
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,959
experiencing itself as you. When you

222
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,360
express that fact loudly, your frequency

223
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,399
immediately switches from separation to

224
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,519
unity. The archons are unable to track

225
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,920
that frequency. They exist in a separate

226
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,800
consciousness. They are unable to

227
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,680
perceive the unity frequency. Listen to

228
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,160
me. This is the command. You aren't

229
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,480
begging to be heard. You assert that you

230
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,720
are listened to since the moned is not

231
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,519
separate from you. It does not have to

232
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,399
listen because it is you. However, the

233
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,120
statement creates focus. It leads the

234
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,839
infinite awareness to the exact place of

235
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,079
manifestation you choose to announce.

236
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,519
Think of it as focusing light through a

237
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:38,640
lens. The light was constantly present.

238
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,440
The lens focuses it with precision. The

239
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,240
lens is called hear me. It does not beg

240
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
for attention. It demands focus and

241
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,480
manifests.

242
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,720
This is the directive. You are

243
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,959
collapsing the quantum field into a

244
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,320
precise form rather than asking for it

245
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,480
to happen. Not hoping it is God's will.

246
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,760
You are proclaiming that manifestation

247
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,320
is occurring right now, not later. Not

248
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,720
if the conditions are correct today.

249
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,440
Because time is a productive material

250
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,079
consciousness. Monad awareness acts

251
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,800
outside of time. When you speak in

252
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,600
monatic frequency and declare manifest,

253
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,640
now you are not constrained by linear

254
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,480
causality. You are creating reality in

255
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,920
the same manner that the source has

256
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,720
always done through word, frequency, and

257
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,120
absolute knowing. When you combine these

258
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,240
three statements and say them publicly,

259
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,320
you are doing precisely what Jesus did.

260
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,959
You're acting as the monad rather than

261
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,440
praying to it. The archons cannot

262
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,640
intercept this shift. They're programmed

263
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,760
to feed on isolation, repetition,

264
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,880
anxiety, need, and pleading,

265
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,680
desperation. That is their range. But

266
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,560
when you talk, I am a man. Hear me

267
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,000
manifest. You are now transmitting at

268
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,800
unity frequency. And at that frequency,

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,680
you are invisible to them. They cannot

270
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,240
perceive it. They cannot tamper with it.

271
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,920
They cannot draw energy from it. You

272
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,560
have completely escaped their

273
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,279
operational range. Here's what occurs

274
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,000
when you complete your first Monet call.

275
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:22,079
I am referring to the present moment,

276
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,480
not days later. Immediately. First, you

277
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,440
will experience a bodily shift in your

278
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,800
solar plexus. Not imagined, not

279
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,560
figurative, but a real sensation as if

280
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,519
something had been closed and then

281
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,240
unlocked. Like a lock clicked. That is

282
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,320
the direct line indicating that you are

283
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,839
no longer sending prayers up through

284
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,399
layers in the hopes that they would

285
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,720
reach someone. You've created a conduit

286
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,360
that flows directly from your core to

287
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,000
the source and you'll feel it. Some of

288
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,399
the chosen ones describe it as warmth

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,440
while others describe it as a release of

290
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,480
pressure or a gentle vibration. However,

291
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,760
it appears for you. You will know it's

292
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,000
clear. Second, mental clarity is

293
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,120
immediate. If you've been suffering from

294
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,160
confusion, doubt, or mental fog, it

295
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,480
won't go away slowly over weeks. Right

296
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,040
now, the questions you couldn't answer

297
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,600
have apparent answers. The choices

298
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,440
you've been mulling over become evident.

299
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,000
That does not mean you are suddenly

300
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,240
becoming smarter. That is archon

301
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,959
interference cutting out. They

302
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,200
manipulate mostly through confusion.

303
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,760
They leave you in uncertainty,

304
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,079
second-guessing, and mental static.

305
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,560
However, when you call the monad and

306
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,120
operate at a unity frequency, its

307
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,320
interference cannot reach you. The

308
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,480
signal is clean. Your mind functions as

309
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,360
it was intended to function before they

310
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,399
clouded it. Third, synchronization

311
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,120
reacts within hours. Most chosen

312
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,160
individuals report this within 1 to 3

313
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,079
hours after their initial monad call.

314
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,959
Something happens that cannot be

315
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,959
explained as a coincidence. The text

316
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,600
came from the exact person they needed

317
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,160
to hear from, revealing an unexpected

318
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,440
solution and a door opening they had no

319
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,000
idea existed. The monad does not take

320
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,000
days to certify your alignment. It

321
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,880
replies quickly because you are not

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,279
asking it to help you. Finally, you

323
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,320
declared manifestation.

324
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,279
And now means now. Look out for it. It

325
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,320
will come. When it does, you'll identify

326
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,880
it right away. Not as luck but as a

327
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,160
response. This is the distinction

328
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,639
between prayer and monatic call. God, if

329
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,880
you're there, could you please help me?

330
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,760
The manad call indicates that I am

331
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,360
source consciousness. This is currently

332
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,160
unfolding. One person is begging. One

333
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,639
person is commanding. Prayer keeps you

334
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,639
reliant. The monad call makes you

335
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,880
sovereign. And once you feel the

336
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,199
difference after calling the monad and

337
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,040
experiencing that immediate shift,

338
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,519
you'll never go back to praying the old

339
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,120
way because you'll know this is not a

340
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,160
theory. This strategy works. The monad

341
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,320
call only applies to pneumatics. Helix

342
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,040
cannot access it for those who have been

343
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,760
chosen, such as yourself. They don't

344
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,040
possess the divine spark. They can say

345
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,920
the words, but nothing happens. Psychics

346
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,160
have inconsistent access to it. Their

347
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,720
bright bodies flash for you. Your

348
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,600
pneumatic. You have the whole heavenly

349
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,320
blueprint. The Manad call is intended

350
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,279
for you. The direct line is already

351
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,360
present. It's been there all your life.

352
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,639
You didn't know how to activate it until

353
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,279
now. The archons fear the Manad call

354
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,680
more than any other spiritual activity

355
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,320
since it renders you inaccessible.

356
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,560
They've created entire systems,

357
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,480
religious structures, and cultural

358
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,880
conditioning to keep you praying rather

359
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,199
than calling. Prayer puts you within

360
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,360
their range, whereas calling pulls you

361
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,399
out of it. When you start phoning

362
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,800
instead of praying, you lose control.

363
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,759
That is why the church eliminated all

364
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,839
references to this practice. That is why

365
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,480
the Gnostic instructors who knew about

366
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,959
it were assassinated because the manad

367
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,839
call is the single factor that causes

368
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,959
their entire harvest system to fail. But

369
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,279
you've got it now. The exact words Jesus

370
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,399
taught and the same method the church

371
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:33,360
attempted to obliterate. I am on it.

372
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,880
Hear me manifest now. Three assertions

373
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,440
and nine words. Archons cannot intercept

374
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,839
this direct channel and institutions

375
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,560
cannot control it. If you're calling the

376
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,440
monad tonight, take three actions right

377
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,639
now. The first comment below refers to

378
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,120
the monad. Declare your direct line.

379
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,279
Claim your authority. Let your chosen

380
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,639
ones know that you are activating this

381
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,800
tonight. Second, subscribe to Atherreic

382
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,519
Code Laboratory, which provides

383
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,480
sophisticated monad call mechanisms for

384
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,439
specialized manifestations, protection,

385
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,240
and the ability to see archons. All of

386
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,120
this is coming. Third, I like this

387
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,679
video. So, other chosen ones realize

388
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,799
they no longer need to pray. They can

389
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,480
now call all three. Do not wait. Your

390
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:28,400
declaration is essential. Then tonight

391
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,280
before you sleep, stand. Stay grounded.

392
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,600
Take three breaths. Feel the realization

393
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,200
that you are a monatic awareness in

394
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,160
human form and speak forth. I am on it.

395
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,120
Hear me manifest now. Then say what you

396
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,919
are manifesting. Hold silent for 30

397
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,799
seconds and see what happens. The shift

398
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,880
in your solar plexus. Clarity floods

399
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,080
your head knowing that you have been

400
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,120
hurt. not through layers nor through

401
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,160
intermediates directly. The archons are

402
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,960
unable to intercept this. This is beyond

403
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,960
the church's control. And the monad is

404
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,520
waiting for you to stop praying and

405
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,400
begin calling. You're not asking for

406
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,200
permission anymore. You are proclaiming

407
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:17,440
reality. And the cosmos responds to

408
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,440
declarations made in unity.
