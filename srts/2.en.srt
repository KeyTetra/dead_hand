1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,879
Jujutsu Kaizen sequel has dropped banger

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:10,320
after banger as chapter 17 reveals Ra's

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,120
return and Surigi looking more insane

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,640
than ever. But that's not all. More

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,119
Yujiadori hype has been dropped. We see

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,760
him speaking to UT's son and we

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,920
literally outright are told he's on

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,240
another level of strength. But Gay

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
doesn't stop cooking because the law we

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,760
learn about jiujitsu society, it's

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,239
totally messed up. FP. Everyone in this

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,600
world carries a curse on their shoulders

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,559
and dies with regrets. Chapter 17 opens

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,680
up with laying that all down about UT's

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:48,079
own family. Uta and Mari smashed with

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,960
their son Iori being born in 2031. He is

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,719
a spitting image of Uta and ended up

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,120
marrying a woman named Muyu. Muyu is the

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,399
same woman that appears in chapter 1,

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,440
who told Yuka at age 10 that she can't

21
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,000
have Ra's ring despite Yuta wishing for

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,720
her to have it. Instead, giving it to

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Surrii, telling him what he wants is

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,000
irrelevant. Muyu married into the Gojo

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,240
and Zenin family, following their

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,640
decisions on who is best suited to

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,200
inherit Ra's power. This set the seed

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,200
for Sudigi's motivation to become strong

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,040
to prove the clans's wrong that he

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,439
doesn't need it. Now, a lot of us were

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
angry that she's an idiot. But with

32
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,960
chapter 17, we understand a lot more

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,840
because Muyu was left alone with Sudigi

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,720
and Yuka as their father left them as

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,000
soon as she was born. As a result, this

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,079
explains why our MC's cling so hard to

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,720
their grandparents and want to be like

38
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,119
them. As they admit in chapter 2, Margi

39
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,200
and Uta had to step in to give them a

40
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,520
real childhood and train them, filling

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,759
the void their father left behind. But

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,560
why exactly did Iori leave? Well,

43
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,040
chapter 17 reveals that Sudigi was

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,680
curious to know as well. He wanted to

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,560
know what kind of person his father was.

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,800
Uta and Mari avoided the subject, but he

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,920
secretly went around asking members of

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,720
the Gojo clan. Iori was a serious and

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,879
diligent person, but that backfired. He

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,000
was chasing a standard he could never

51
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,400
reach. Bro was basically a power scaler

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,680
and he dived so deep into it, he said,

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,000
"Oh [ __ ] wait a second. We're weak as

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,480
hell and our generation is cooked. None

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,040
of us are special grades." So compared

56
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,200
to the generation before him, he felt

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,879
weak. How could they live up to legends

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,519
like his parents, Yugji, or even Saturo?

59
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,599
And then his power scaling didn't stop.

60
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,760
When compared to the sorcerers beneath

61
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,080
him and under his wing, he felt

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,160
responsible. Sorcerers are only getting

63
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,879
weaker, which is widening the problem

64
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,040
against stronger curses. What if another

65
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,519
sukuna appears and they can't deal with

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,000
it? And that pressure turned him into a

67
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,720
man who started breaking down mentally.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,440
But before he became a deadbe and left

69
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,400
the sorcerer world behind, he met Yuji

70
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,360
Itodori. Iori was lashing out at Yugji

71
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,200
about his problem, but our goat said it

72
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,000
doesn't matter. This leads to

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,400
speculation from Surigi that his father

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,200
leaving after Yuka's birth must have

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,840
something to do with power as Surigi was

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,159
heavily restricted. But Yuka was somehow

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,560
born with the 10 shadows. However, he

78
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,120
ponders this huge question. Why didn't

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,879
he just leave after his birth? It must

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,440
have something to do with the presence

81
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,519
or absence of techniques within them.

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,519
Surigi believed that his father must

83
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,920
have felt his role as a sorcerer was

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,080
complete. But the argument with Yuji,

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,640
well, it goes a lot deeper. For

86
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,599
instance, what if Iori tampered with

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,319
Yuka and is actually the cause of her

88
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,720
brain cancer? We know in the sequel,

89
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,879
Mahito still exists and appeared in

90
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,200
chapter 7. He's waiting on the other

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,000
side for Yugji, or from what we can

92
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,239
tell, someone in particular. Mahito

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
prays on human insecurities to

94
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,799
accommodate his goals to the point where

95
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,360
his victims go against any common sense.

96
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,920
But you may be wondering how can Mahito

97
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,799
even be contacted. Well, there is an

98
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,359
area where he resides. Even Kenjaku

99
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,079
showcased this before the culling game a

100
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,120
rift between reality and dreams where he

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,080
contacted players. Similarly, Mahito did

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,880
the same thing in chapter 271. Mahito

103
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,360
meets Sukuna after his passing and tells

104
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,680
him due to his innate ability, he

105
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,240
resides himself within the samsara

106
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,720
cycle. He's in the pathway where souls

107
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,360
walk. And this means everyone who dies

108
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,919
or comes to life can interact with him.

109
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,479
I mean, even Yuka mentioned the cycle of

110
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,720
rebirth before facing Darra, connecting

111
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,880
the plot even more. Now, Mahito's

112
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,600
technique, it could have unlocked the 10

113
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,759
shadows in Yuka. After all, Sukuna

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,080
revealed that cursed techniques reside

115
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,360
in the preffrontal cortex in the brain

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,280
against Gojo. So, if I truly believe

117
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,919
that the next generation needed to be

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,320
stronger at any cost, it's not hard to

119
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,720
imagine him searching for a solution for

120
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,280
his children's defect that would be in

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,919
his eyes. Yuka's brain damage could be

122
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,919
the result of her father doing a binding

123
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,840
vow by making a deal with the devil

124
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,320
himself to get what he wanted.

125
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,360
Especially when you look at chapter 6,

126
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,680
there is no solution for Yuka's cancer.

127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,440
No understanding of what's going on, and

128
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,080
they haven't even heard of this illness

129
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,800
before. And that could be because Mahito

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,680
affected the soul, which makes sense of

131
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,840
everything. Remember that Kenjaku used

132
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,000
idol transfiguration on a massive scale

133
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,919
to start the culling game. He targeted

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,680
people who already had dormant curse

135
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,400
techniques, but lacked the brain

136
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,720
structure to use jiu-jitsu. He literally

137
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,680
rewired their brains so their techniques

138
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,039
could awaken, such as Higuruma. And in

139
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,120
the end, I's argument with Yugji and him

140
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,840
saying it doesn't matter. It could be

141
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,160
our boy telling him what he thinks is

142
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,919
wrong. And his children being the way

143
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,400
they are shouldn't matter to him.

144
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,880
Because Yuji once said to Sukuna, after

145
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,360
all, we were born with the burden of a

146
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,280
curse. Even if no one else accepts it,

147
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,240
he's willing to go on living with him.

148
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,639
So I's role should be to nurture his

149
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,080
kids with what was given rather than

150
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,560
pushing an ideal onto them by force. And

151
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,120
guess what people, this makes perfect

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,199
sense. And the writing is amazing

153
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,680
because this generational trauma

154
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,319
connects to Maru. Well, let's not forget

155
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,639
that he's an inverse of Surigi's

156
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,280
situation. And that's Gay's way of

157
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,160
showing how curses come in all forms.

158
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,880
Maru's curse is having a present father

159
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,360
who left him religious ideals that haunt

160
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,600
him with an obsession while Sudigis is

161
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,479
having an absent father who left him

162
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,199
with scars and curiosity. So people are

163
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,520
missing the point with Maru's ideal to

164
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,520
be a warrior. It makes way more sense

165
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,599
when you see what the culture drilled

166
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,479
into him because on their planet

167
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,800
Lumerian women can't wield cursed energy

168
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,280
so their men have to be warriors by

169
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,240
default. Their jiujutsu is literally

170
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,319
framed as a gift from the gods. And real

171
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,880
men protect women and children because

172
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,759
they can't bear the burden. So Maru is

173
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,319
trying to be worthy of a holy title his

174
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,800
whole society worships. That's why he

175
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,720
can't back down on Sugiri's challenge

176
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,520
and he's not going to give up on the

177
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,479
50,000 refugees on the ship. But let's

178
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,080
not forget Yugji is slowly becoming the

179
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,800
only answer to all the problems. Yuka is

180
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,680
already in a state of suspended death.

181
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,240
The ritual would not end unless Darra is

182
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,400
killed or Maharaga is destroyed. If

183
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,039
either of those things happened, Yuka's

184
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,759
death is guaranteed. This parallels what

185
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,720
happened to Megumi in chapter 117. But

186
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,639
Sukuna used RCT to save him. However,

187
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,639
that's not the only time we have seen

188
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,280
someone be saved from death. It happened

189
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,199
to Yugji twice. First, when Sukuna

190
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,840
ripped his heart out and then revived

191
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,560
him, and later when UT killed him and

192
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,360
used RCT to bring him back. All of this

193
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,759
links to a huge plot point fans believe

194
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,560
will happen. Yugji is going to save the

195
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,280
day by helping Yuka live and taking on

196
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,599
Darura or Mahuraga, depending on the

197
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,160
outcome. This would parallel Sukuna's

198
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,479
fuga moment perfectly, as Yuji would

199
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,880
form a height moment and aura by

200
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,120
displaying his new powers immediately

201
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,279
upon arrival. I still believe that

202
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,279
Maru's harmony technique can also come

203
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,519
into play to locate Yugji because

204
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,839
Sukuna's finger is still holding up a

205
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,080
barrier and that can be used to resonate

206
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,080
with his essence to find Yugji anywhere

207
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,160
in the world to help humanity. That

208
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,080
would fit the writing of his character

209
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,240
development to believe in coexistence

210
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,720
and peace again. putting aside his

211
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,120
obsession and curse to be a warrior.

212
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,680
Like, bro, I'm going to crash out if

213
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,920
Yuji got hyped this much and doesn't

214
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,399
appear once in this sequel. Gay

215
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,480
literally drew how prime Yuji looks

216
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,880
like. And it's it's depressing. Look at

217
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,360
his eyes. He's looking around 20 years

218
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,760
old and more like his uncle Sukuna. Give

219
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,760
him a break. Give him a hypora moment.

220
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,240
You know what I'm saying? And at this

221
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,959
point, Yuji understands something most

222
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,279
sorcerers never will. The world is in a

223
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,440
balance. When Gojo was born, the world

224
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,680
responded by creating stronger special

225
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,000
grade curses, right? And when Sukuna

226
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,920
rose, humanity was forced to produce

227
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,839
monsters of its own just to survive

228
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,000
where they all became special grade. So

229
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,640
when Yuji says it doesn't matter how

230
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,200
strong sorcerers are, he's implying that

231
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,519
chasing strength is meaningless because

232
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,600
the jiu-jitsu system will always find a

233
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,839
way to correct itself. The wheel will

234
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,320
never stop turning. And that's why in

235
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,720
the sequel, I think Yuji wants to break

236
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,600
it. He's searching for a plan to

237
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,760
eliminate curse energy altogether. Just

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,080
like Yuki was researching in the

239
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,040
original manga, she believed the only

240
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,680
way to end curses was by eliminating its

241
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,760
source. She identified that curse energy

242
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,680
is produced by humans through negative

243
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,399
emotions, right? Which means killing

244
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,880
curses is only a temporary fix because

245
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,040
new ones will always be born. And Yuji

246
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,000
has been witnessing this for six bloody

247
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,959
decades. This also ties directly into

248
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,680
Yuji's own problem of being immortal.

249
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,920
Yugji wants to die and he wants a good

250
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,640
death surrounded by friends without

251
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,959
regrets. And to do that, he needs to

252
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,279
break the wheel with the others just

253
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,160
like Yuka and Cross promised to each

254
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,480
other and bloody mention. Chapter 17

255
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,120
then picks up the fight between friends

256
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,839
immediately. Maru's technique of chaos

257
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,519
and order disrupting physics has Surigi

258
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,600
on the back burner. He doesn't

259
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,680
understand the technique yet and almost

260
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,399
falls off a building. He can't even get

261
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,640
close. Maru then immediately jumps in to

262
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,200
stab and is launching him all over the

263
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,519
building like a play toy. But eventually

264
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,000
he figures out a counter and makes both

265
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,320
of them lose their swords. But as they

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,880
race to pick them up, they clash once

267
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,720
again. However, Sugiri's sword is caught

268
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,880
between Maru's blade, trapping him

269
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
inside using his physical strength

270
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,760
against him. With that, he busts him

271
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,320
outside and they have a chat midair

272
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,560
before the final blow. Sugiri thinks to

273
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,360
himself that he might have won. And even

274
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,519
if there was a 1% chance that Yuka can

275
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,160
be saved, then he would always bet on

276
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,959
that just like Maru would for his own

277
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,640
cause. Now this beautifully connects to

278
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,959
another plot point from the original

279
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,399
manga that you cannot forget. Remember

280
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,959
that Kjaku stated life is a gamble and

281
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,560
people who do not take a step in action

282
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,640
whilst looking at death in front of

283
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,120
their eyes they are absolutely

284
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,680
detestable. Even Hakari believe that

285
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,240
everyone in life gamles on something.

286
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,640
This is their fever of trying to change

287
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,640
things in some way. But the true manner

288
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,880
of dealing with this fever is by

289
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,200
gambling. He thinks that society

290
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,360
tramples on people who can't bet big

291
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,839
enough, meaning people who can't take

292
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,160
chances to progress their goal. This is

293
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,839
something even Gojo mentioned to Uta

294
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,680
whilst they were training, mentioning

295
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,320
the fever once again. So this is

296
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,800
something that we find Cross, Yuka, and

297
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,200
Sugiri doing, right? And it will tie

298
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,160
into how they will make Maru have a

299
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,639
change of heart to gamble on coexistence

300
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,200
once again since his ass is about to get

301
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,240
beaten into a pole. Because although

302
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Sugiri gets completely destroyed,

303
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,760
multiple cars thrown at him, explosions,

304
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,399
a whole ass building collapsing and

305
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,240
dashed into the ground. If this dude was

306
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,320
any other human without heavenly

307
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,040
restriction, then he would have been

308
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,079
finished. Now, the look of despair on

309
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,920
Maru's face tells it all. Obviously, my

310
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,360
guy doesn't want his friend to suffer by

311
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,920
his hands, and he doesn't want to kill

312
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,240
him. But Maru's love for his brother and

313
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,880
his duty as a warrior supersedes

314
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,519
everything. However, Sugiri is not done.

315
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,760
He thinks about his father's ideology of

316
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,240
valuing strength and power. He accepts

317
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,240
that being born great and having a great

318
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,639
death is something to be proud of. But

319
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,360
he can't accept that way of thinking.

320
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,839
Like Yuji who told Sukuna how every life

321
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,399
and memory is precious. He thinks that

322
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,320
even if a person's life is ordinary and

323
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,639
vague. As long as their everyday

324
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,200
existence was out there, then that was

325
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,839
enough. This testament is a reference to

326
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
his father who saw himself as trash

327
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,639
became depressed and then disappeared.

328
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,040
Now at this moment, Uda's ring on his

329
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,680
neck starts glowing. Cursed energy

330
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,959
floods out. Sugiri thinks his grandpa is

331
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,920
here, but no, it's the queen of curses,

332
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,920
Ra. She disappointedly tells him how

333
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,720
takes after Maki, calling her that

334
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,279
woman, reminding us how Ra was obsessed

335
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,040
with UT and was jealous of Mari that she

336
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,480
ended up with him marrying, smashing,

337
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,800
all that good [ __ ] Now, I do want to

338
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,959
mention that this panel right here, oh

339
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,720
my god, hypeora moment. Absolutely fire.

340
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,519
[screaming]

341
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,600
Now eventually they form a contract and

342
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,480
because of Uther's requests and their

343
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,800
undying love, Ria was told to help the

344
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,519
progeny of his bloodline. So she does

345
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,720
just that and tells Sugiri to accept the

346
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,639
deal. And with one word, he becomes a

347
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,480
special grave. Just like we had

348
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,279
predicted, he has become one of the

349
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,760
strongest sorcerers to exist. Though he

350
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,959
doesn't have a full restriction like Oji

351
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,680
and Mari, his body is insanely strong.

352
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,079
And now with RA's immense curse energy

353
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,120
reserve, he has become completely

354
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,600
broken. Ra merges with his body, showing

355
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,480
us a new transformation we haven't seen.

356
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,560
And before Maru can blink twice and say

357
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,360
anything, questioning who this new

358
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,639
challenger is, Ra gives him a quick

359
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,120
write, sending the Samrian flying busted

360
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,680
all open. Now remember, one of R's

361
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,839
ability is curse technique storage. So

362
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,000
whatever UT probably copied is probably

363
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,160
still in there. So he has access to all

364
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
of that now too. And there's also the

365
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,480
cursed tool storage which has all these

366
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,360
special grade weapons sitting inside of

367
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,199
her. So he is completely busted and we

368
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,839
cannot even fathom what the hell is

369
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:23,199
going to happen next. Now everything is

370
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,920
adding up. Sugiri will defeat Mu now and

371
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,360
convince him that with RA now back they

372
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,000
can use RCT on cross and save it.

373
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,040
Remember, Ra was able to use positive

374
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,600
energy to heal UT. And in chapter 269,

375
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,000
it was absolutely an insane feat because

376
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,320
he explained how Ra was able to heal and

377
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,639
even sustain his dead ass body whilst

378
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,519
his brain wasn't in it. Now, currently,

379
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,000
the level of RCT the Jutsu sorcerers

380
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,040
have is weak. In the sequel, in chapter

381
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,440
13, the healer literally called herself

382
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,240
trash while she was trying to heal Usami

383
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,800
and Cross. But with Ra, things have now

384
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,040
changed. Not only can she heal Cross,

385
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,360
but even Yuka. Remember that this fight

386
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,600
is happening before Mahur Raga and

387
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,000
Darra, which means once this is over,

388
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,839
they will still have time to save her.

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,480
We can't forget that there's another

390
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,199
option for these people. The Samrians

391
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,279
can manage the Kalan in Tokyo and will

392
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,040
be allowed to reside there, which was an

393
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,959
option that they had. And with the

394
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
condition that no curse can leave the

395
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,240
vicinity, it's a win-win for both

396
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,000
parties. Ra is also a Kalano member.

397
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,399
according to them since she's a cursed

398
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,759
spirit. Imagine she kills another cursed

399
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,680
spirit in front of them. They're going

400
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,759
to be thinking, "Wait a second. Why is

401
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,120
Kalan killing Kalan?" And then they're

402
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,040
going to question their beliefs and

403
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,480
realize, "Wait a second, the humans were

404
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,120
telling the truth. This is something

405
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,839
else." Another point to make is that

406
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,160
Sugiri directly parallels Megumi, who

407
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,560
failed to save his own sister. These two

408
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,680
characters mirror each other, but their

409
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,839
outcomes diverge. Now, to enjoy more
