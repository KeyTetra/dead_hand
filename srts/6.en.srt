1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,800
What's going on Gemini? How are you

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,319
doing? Hope you're doing very well. This

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,160
is the Autistic Mystic and this is going

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,519
to be your weekly reading for December

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,800
31st through January 4th, 2026. So, in

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,240
this reading, Gemini, we're going to

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
take a look at your overall general

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,679
energy. Some things you do not see

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,279
coming and also get some advice from

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,560
your angels and spirit guides for you

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,519
and so much more regarding the 31st to

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,359
the 4th, the first week of the new year

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,680
essentially. So, thank you so much for

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,160
being here. As always, you are very

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,000
welcome here in this space with me as we

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,680
go through this reading. I really do

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,360
appreciate you in advance for taking the

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,960
time to check this reading out. And if

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,640
it does resonate with you, definitely

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,320
smash that like button, subscribe down

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,920
below if you have not already for future

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,600
updates. That would also be greatly

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,559
appreciated over here. So, without

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,160
further ado, I'm going to pull the

25
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,160
energy for you and see what's cracking

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,600
and see what's coming through. So, let's

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,280
go. As always, I would like to thank the

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,719
angels,

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,760
the interdimensional beings and the

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:06,120
spirit guides who are overseeing this

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,120
the divination for the sign of Gemini.

32
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,759
Okay.

33
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,800
So the first thing that is coming

34
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:11,120
through Gemini is that the self-doubt

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,080
that you are currently experiencing is

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,120
not a match, not a vibrational match to

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,200
what needs to be said or done for the

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,120
31st of December to the 4th of January.

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,879
The self-doubt that you are experiencing

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,040
is not a match to what needs to be said

41
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,920
and done. You need to become more like

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,680
Neo in the Matrix. You need to think

43
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,120
outside of the box right now because

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,720
there's a lot of advice for you. The

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,640
energy that you need to embody more of

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,959
is all about confidence, immunity,

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,120
healing, and integration. So, first

48
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,920
things first, having confidence in

49
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,319
yourself. Also, you are not as

50
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,160
vulnerable right now to certain energies

51
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,040
that may be trying to adhere to you at

52
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,280
this time. The more you think that you

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,239
are vulnerable, the more that you will

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,640
become vulnerable in some sort of way.

55
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,239
So, you're not as vulnerable as you

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
think to something, but there needs to

57
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,800
be some sort of putting together,

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,640
putting the pieces back together because

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
um it's showing me that in some way,

60
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,280
shape, or form, you're essentially

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,840
fragmented right now within your own

62
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,879
psyche or within your own soul. There's

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,959
definitely fragments that need to be put

64
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,040
back together, put back in place, but

65
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,640
it's not going to be an easy road for

66
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,480
you to do that. But the way that you do

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,080
that for a lot of you is basically just

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
finding a way to get your confidence

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,000
back, doing something that you're

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,840
already good at or starting something

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,200
new. For a lot of you, this is all about

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,959
um the idea of a fresh new start

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,519
relative to something in your life that

74
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,760
will allow you to spiritually integrate.

75
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,080
It's been a really interesting journey

76
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:49,280
for me as I ride this Saturn return

77
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,480
journey. And a lot of what's happening

78
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,480
is that um it seems like there's like

79
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,680
walk in soul like from a spiritual

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,000
perspective I'm having like all these

81
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,000
aspects of my own consciousness that I

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,799
knew I would eventually get to basically

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,640
like take on a whole persona take on a

84
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,400
whole being a whole separate being

85
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,879
that's basically like a walk-in soul.

86
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,439
It's like my own consciousness. I have a

87
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,040
different conscience about things

88
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,440
because of where I'm going and what I'm

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,000
doing and what I need to do compared to

90
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,000
my old integrated state of consciousness

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
that was good for that period of time.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,919
So for you the advice that's what's

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,479
happening is that if many of you have

94
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,000
like um a lot of anxiety about life at

95
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,759
this time for a lot of you it's about

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,160
the idea that you could be having a you

97
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,240
are having a spiritual integration that

98
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,840
allows you to experience the opposite of

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,680
some sort of trauma that you've been

100
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,160
going through.

101
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,759
Okay. So and that may not look how you

102
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,759
think it looks. It may not look as

103
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,759
exciting. I definitely think that's one

104
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:57,440
of the things here with this reading

105
00:04:51,759 --> 00:05:01,360
Gemini for you from the 31st to um the

106
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:05,120
uh 4th is that it's kind of like back to

107
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,120
square one. You may not

108
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,280
know what to do because of different

109
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,199
fragments. You know, the energy that you

110
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,800
need more of, the energy that you need

111
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
more of to embody for your own highest

112
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,880
good. One of these cards is the oracle

113
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,280
card of integration.

114
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,600
And integration is all about bringing

115
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,240
two seemingly opposite things that are

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,440
highly fragmented and polarized back

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,280
into one single working unit or at least

118
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,440
a cooperative unit, but basically

119
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,960
becoming whole and complete within parts

120
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,479
of yourself that are going in two

121
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,080
different directions. And you may have a

122
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,600
lot of these. This is especially what

123
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,039
Gemini is known for. So, a lot of your

124
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,400
confidence is going to occur actually

125
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,160
through the idea that you think your

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,520
life is effed up. You think you're the

127
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,080
only one going through what you're going

128
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,840
through. You're not. Pain likes to

129
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,680
convince you that you're the only one

130
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,080
going through. No one has it as bad as

131
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,080
me. I'm the only one going through this,

132
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,400
etc. We are all going through basically

133
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,360
a collective nightmare at this moment

134
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,440
from a certain perspective. And one

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,479
thing pain likes to do is to make you

136
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,039
think that you're going through it

137
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,240
alone. But you may not be as alone as

138
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,240
you think. Especially in terms of

139
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,360
how you navigate this. This is a big

140
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,199
choice point for you. I want to

141
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,680
emphasize this that on a practical

142
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,240
level. It seems like you have the whole

143
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,160
world in the palm of your hands in some

144
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,479
sort of risky

145
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
new life decision going forward or you

146
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,039
have a safe option that you can

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,199
basically basically cash in on and be

148
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,280
relatively good. But there's some advice

149
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,280
here that your safe option may be taken

150
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,880
away from you.

151
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,400
Uh

152
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,120
there's a quote coming into my mind

153
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,479
about like it's it's like I don't want

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,319
to scare any of you but it's like

155
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,919
literally it's like do you have a

156
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,840
backup? And I don't believe in

157
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,639
retirement, but do you have a backup

158
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,639
retirement plan? And it's cool if you

159
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,039
do, but do you have a backup retirement

160
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,520
plan when your retirement plan doesn't

161
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,240
work anymore?

162
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,240
Because there's some sort of risky new

163
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
right of passage that's amazing that's

164
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,000
standing in front of you. Or you have

165
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,160
the the safe bet that you have basically

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,919
been cashing in on a certain plan of

167
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,120
your life, a certain way that you

168
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,720
thought things were going to go. Your

169
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,160
challenge is that that set plan is not

170
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,440
as set anymore at all.

171
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,280
Something that you've been building up

172
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,039
towards planting the seeds hoping that

173
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,639
they would sprout. The honest assessment

174
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,440
of this reading is that there is a

175
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,680
possibility that they can still sprout.

176
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,520
But there's also a big possibility that

177
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,800
they just completely get taken away from

178
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,360
you, something that you've been

179
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,280
building. So there needs to be a plan B

180
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,199
for there needs to be a backup plan for

181
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,800
every backup plan. And I don't want to

182
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
confuse you to make you more fragmented.

183
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,680
Maybe there's just needs to be one new

184
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,120
risky option that you consider in your

185
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,639
reality in some sort of way. I'll

186
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,360
explain why this is happening in a

187
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,879
moment. But let's go to your

188
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,720
opportunity. This reading came out with

189
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,240
two cards in the opportunity, two cards

190
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,520
in the challenge. So your opportunity is

191
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,120
the justice card and the ace of wands.

192
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,520
And the justice card is also the

193
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,440
opportunity for Aquarius. So there may

194
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,360
be a connection there. The Ace of Wands

195
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,319
is all about a fresh new start relative

196
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,080
to inspiration, healing the spirit as

197
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,639
well. It's funny that I talked about

198
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,240
walk-in souls in this reading. There are

199
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
certain aspects of your consciousness

200
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,720
that are that are ready to to come on

201
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,400
board in order to help you heal. So it

202
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,800
may feel like you have taken on a

203
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,519
completely new persona. A completely new

204
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,560
side of you is ready to start taking

205
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,080
control of the show. The question is,

206
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,959
are you ready to let that side take

207
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,640
control of the show or not? Um, this is

208
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,159
all about bringing balance to the realm

209
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,800
of thought relative to your own

210
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,560
confidence in life, your ability to take

211
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,959
risks, your ability to act on

212
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,480
inspiration. This is all of your

213
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,959
opportunity because there's something

214
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,880
that you need to do in order to remove

215
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,640
the self-doubt that is not currently a

216
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,000
match to the situation. But even if you

217
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
remove the self-doubt, you're still

218
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
stuck in a risky scenario. And that's

219
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,240
just how it's going right now according

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,120
to an accurate reader. So in your

221
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,760
challenge you have the six of swords and

222
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,760
the knight of cups.

223
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,240
So I do feel that there's some sort of

224
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,760
idealistic vision that you've had that

225
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,000
is now becoming less and less

226
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,399
idealistic, less and less romantic, less

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,640
and less realistic for you.

228
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,440
And now it's time to move on to a new

229
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,120
vision, to a new idealism, to a new

230
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
thing that you set your sights out on.

231
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,920
Now, for some of you, quite frankly, you

232
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,519
could just be going through a breakup

233
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,360
within your relationships. And this is

234
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,000
the challenge when it comes to your

235
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,839
romance. There could be a shift from one

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
partner to another or something like

237
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,360
that or the want, the desire for that.

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
It doesn't have to be like that, but

239
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,200
that could be what's going on with this.

240
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,240
The six of swords and the knight of cups

241
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,080
could be something about you idealizing

242
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,080
your reality that has to come to an end

243
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,399
and you need to set a new goal and start

244
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,760
idealizing something else. But it's

245
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,240
really up to you because you have a

246
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,160
major choice point and remember that

247
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,320
you're not as vulnerable as you think

248
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,760
you are at this time. You do have a lot

249
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,720
of um opportunities to regain your

250
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,880
confidence at this time, but the safer

251
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,600
option is super risky for you at this

252
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,839
time. And so is the new option. There is

253
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,360
no safe option for you at this time. But

254
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,360
guess what? You did not come here to

255
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,120
arrive at death safely in this reality.

256
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,560
All that you do when you play it safe is

257
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:38,360
you get to your bed with uh your your

258
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,360
deathbed with regrets.

259
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,880
um

260
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,160
sometimes.

261
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,160
But let me show you the so so romantic

262
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,480
issues, not knowing whether you should

263
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,240
move on from a romantic situation or not

264
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,440
because a lot of you have a cold partner

265
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,440
that you're not connecting with

266
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,440
emotionally.

267
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,720
For the mas for the Gemini um men out

268
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,040
there, there can be a real cold [ __ ] in

269
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,920
your life that just makes you feel

270
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,600
emotionally horrible.

271
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,839
They might they just make you feel

272
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:19,360
emotionally horrible. They make you feel

273
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:22,360
horrible. They make your heart closed

274
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,360
basically.

275
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,480
For the Gemini women out there, there's

276
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,399
probably a man in your life that is very

277
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,600
cold as well that gives you a lot of

278
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,560
emotional problems. So for a lot of you,

279
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,920
you are stuck in the situation. I will

280
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:42,800
say this song, should I stay or should I

281
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:46,000
go? And that of course is a featured

282
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:50,120
song in Stranger Things which I have

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,120
been on the real life set of

284
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,560
gaslight set non- gaslight set you know

285
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,560
it's all there.

286
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Um,

287
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,959
let's go to your overall general energy.

288
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,200
And this is the choice point that I was

289
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,200
pointing out to you.

290
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,720
You

291
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,160
have the two of wands, which is a choice

292
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,480
point, a safer option behind you,

293
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,839
including that seven of pentacles. You

294
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,920
have the four of wands ahead of you, a

295
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,000
right of passage, which requires

296
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,760
enthusiasm, a risk of danger, but you

297
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,399
are in the right frequency. So, you're

298
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,959
not in a bad space. You do have options

299
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:37,920
at this time.

300
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:40,240
Um, you do have options at this time,

301
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,560
but you need to follow the one that will

302
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,560
increase your confidence basically at

303
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,240
this time and and induce a state of

304
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,560
healing and

305
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,079
integrating yourself in some sort of

306
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,079
way. cuz you may have a really split

307
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,320
personality that someone in your life is

308
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,880
basically just like causing you to

309
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,480
become to have to become more split. And

310
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,079
I don't think it's your fault. I feel

311
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,360
like there's a there's a situation in

312
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,959
your life or you have two different

313
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,639
sides to yourself. You keep getting

314
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,720
pushed into one side of yourself because

315
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:13,760
you're like you need to do that in this

316
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:17,639
reality or something like that. Um

317
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,639
so be aware of that

318
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,720
in

319
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,079
your uh

320
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,680
what you don't see coming. You have the

321
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,079
king of swords, the lovers card, and the

322
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,000
five of cups.

323
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,480
So yeah, a lot of coldness, not being on

324
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,680
the same page on an emotional level. For

325
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,360
some of you, this is definitely going to

326
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,279
have to do with a soulmate experience.

327
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,120
Lovers, you know, reality feels harsh,

328
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,839
reality feels bleak. I want to go out on

329
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,200
a limb and say that a lot of you are

330
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,120
for some of you, you're not with the

331
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,639
right person and you already know that,

332
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,279
but you have to be with them for some

333
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,560
sort of reason right now. For a lot of

334
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,959
you, and I don't want to make this sound

335
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,480
like a romantic novel because you don't

336
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,120
need a soulmate to be whole and

337
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,880
complete. You don't need it, but a lot

338
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,800
of your life force energy is somehow

339
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,079
being drained by like not being with

340
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,079
someone that you're meant to be with.

341
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,480
And for some of you, you feel like

342
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,240
you're caught in a lose-lose situation

343
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,279
relative to this choice that you need to

344
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,839
make on a romantic level

345
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,519
or just regaining your confidence to go

346
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
out on a quest because some of you you

347
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,480
need to re completely

348
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,000
um you need to completely revamp your

349
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,480
requ your your quest in life. Start a

350
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,600
new quest in life with this justice card

351
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,120
and the ace of wands. Do something bold.

352
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,279
Fortune favors the bold. But

353
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,760
in your advice, you have the five of

354
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,639
pentacles, the nine of cups, and the

355
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,199
seven of swords.

356
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,600
So, here's the cautionary tale part of

357
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,279
this reading. There may be something

358
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,120
that you need to do to outsmart

359
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,040
someone. For a lot of you, you're being

360
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,480
schemed. You're being tricked into a

361
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,560
situation that you didn't even realize

362
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,440
you were being schemed or tricked into.

363
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,920
A lot of this is saying, "Watch out."

364
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,000
out. For some of you, you need to like

365
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,600
realize that something that you've been

366
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,279
investing in, that you thought was going

367
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,320
to go good, that you thought could you

368
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,399
could work through, that you could

369
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,279
overcome now is drying up,

370
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,760
but you still have a chance to make it

371
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,160
work with that, but it seems like it's

372
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,160
drying up.

373
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,680
And then you have this seven of swords

374
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,160
with your nine of pentac, your nine of

375
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,079
um nine of cups. So this does talk about

376
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,920
the idea of trickery relative to

377
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,839
synchronicity. The idea of being on the

378
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,440
lookout for negative synchronicity.

379
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,920
Sometimes following signs and

380
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,279
synchronicities lead you straight to the

381
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,120
thing that you want that will increase

382
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,959
your expansion. Sometimes it will lead

383
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,440
you straight to hell. Because the idea

384
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,440
is that if you are always at the effect

385
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,560
of what you are receiving and following

386
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,240
the signs like a blind or like a dog,

387
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,000
then it may lead you to something that

388
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,759
will lead to your expansion. But if you

389
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,440
can kind of cultivate this is what I

390
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,440
want. I know what I want. I know who I

391
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,320
want. I know what I want, etc. It will

392
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,720
just streamline you there. And I'm not

393
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,920
saying it's your fault for that because

394
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:19,079
right now there's a big, as we know,

395
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,079
there's a big AI arms race going on

396
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,079
and that filters down into citizen life.

397
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,199
So unfortunately, there's a lot of signs

398
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,079
and synchronicities that are being put

399
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,079
in your path by people or groups of

400
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,920
being or by AI beings or whatever that

401
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,800
do not have your best interest in hand

402
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,320
to basically make you think you are

403
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,639
doing the right thing by following the

404
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,120
signs and synchronicities when may or

405
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,519
may you're leading straight to the path

406
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,199
of hell. So this is about the advice is

407
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,399
that is that there's people trying to

408
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,079
scheme your synchronicities.

409
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,240
There's there's beings there's people

410
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:06,240
trying to scheme your synchronicities,

411
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,000
trying to put something there, trying to

412
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,360
gaslight you in some sort of way. For

413
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,799
others of you, it's letting you know

414
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,799
that you need to come up with a new plan

415
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,000
before your old plan gets completely

416
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,000
dried up in some sort of way.

417
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,520
That's really what I feel about this

418
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:32,520
reading. So, now let's go ahead and get

419
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,520
into um some more of it.

420
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,400
Let's go ahead and clarify why this two

421
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,360
of wands, this choice point, you do have

422
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,480
the tower and the

423
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:51,320
uh wheel of fortune coming in.

424
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,320
Why is the two of wands here for you

425
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,600
in your overall general energy?

426
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,320
Knight of wands. This is definitely

427
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,000
about the contemplation of a new

428
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,000
adventure with that justice card and the

429
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,559
ace of wands. A new beginning. A lot of

430
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,440
fiery energy relative to this choice

431
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,280
point. Having confidence in yourself,

432
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,280
but there could be travel involved with

433
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,039
this. There could be a new journey that

434
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,320
you have to give you an old journey

435
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,160
you're giving up a new journey you're

436
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,679
you're going on. Why is the two of wo of

437
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,600
wands here for you?

438
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,840
There's something about this investment

439
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,200
or something leading to betrayal or

440
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,120
something like that. The seven of

441
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,960
pentacles is clarified by the page of

442
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,720
wands, the devil, the seven of cups, and

443
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,480
the nine of swords.

444
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,080
So, it seems like this is your new

445
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,799
point. Like when I shuffled this, they

446
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,120
jumped right on the direction. This ace,

447
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,960
this knight of wands jumped right into

448
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,679
the future, right into the more risky

449
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,320
option that leads you to

450
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,960
the four of wands and having to navigate

451
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,360
a scheming synchronicity timeline. It

452
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,160
does seem like some like the danger of

453
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,960
this is this. Whatever your backup plan

454
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,799
is or whatever set plan you have is or

455
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,600
something like that, Gemini. Um it seems

456
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,720
to be leading you to a nightmarish

457
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,240
situation with this devil card, nine of

458
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,480
swords

459
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,320
and the and the seven of cups. It seems

460
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,640
to be leading to emotional heartbreak,

461
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,480
confusion,

462
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,840
a and things like that. and a lot of

463
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,840
immaturity or something like that.

464
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,320
For some of you, this is about the idea

465
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,880
of like completing something or going

466
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,880
back in time.

467
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,000
But at the same time, this is about

468
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,080
something that you've been investing in.

469
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,760
The safer option is no longer going to

470
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,760
work because of some sort of reason.

471
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,880
So you have a risky option in front of

472
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,880
you, but that's honestly what's looking

473
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,880
like the really only option for you.

474
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,919
So you have a choice for a lot of you.

475
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,400
You also have a choice to be with

476
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,200
someone who's a little bit emotionally

477
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:22,280
cold

478
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,280
versus uh emotional wreck.

479
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Um,

480
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,280
but

481
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,280
don't judge a book by its cover.

482
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,120
Let's go ahead now and uh keep going.

483
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,400
Let's clarify that justice and ace of

484
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,400
wands in your opportunity here.

485
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,400
Yeah, you have that five of cups popping

486
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,159
right out on that five of pentacles. You

487
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
also have the five of cups and what you

488
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,080
don't see coming. So, this is now a

489
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,080
duplicate. So, there is some sort of

490
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,320
justice ace of wands with the star card

491
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,320
and the five of cups. So this is all

492
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,159
about healing, integrating your sadness,

493
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,840
integrating your sadness here, Gemini,

494
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
in some sort of way. A new beginning

495
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,080
that helps you move on from the past

496
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,919
because a lot of times this is a change

497
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,799
to your emotions. The number five has to

498
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,919
do with change, traveling. The cups have

499
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,080
to do with emotions. There's something

500
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,960
that you're you're trying to drink these

501
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,960
cups. They already they're done. And

502
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,520
there's a fresh spring of water right

503
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,880
here that's just flowing constantly. and

504
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,280
it's going to lead to you to a new

505
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:50,120
beginning. But a lot of you are like

506
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,120
like and I don't mean to be fish

507
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,240
I don't mean to be fish I

508
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,880
I don't mean to be rude

509
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,120
but some of you are trying to pick up

510
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,360
cups that are completely empty and drink

511
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,360
from them.

512
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,919
So you need to become confident enough

513
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,600
so that you don't end up in that

514
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:23,159
situation. I don't I just don't

515
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,159
understand you.

516
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,760
Judgement on a scheme

517
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,039
there. There's definitely judgement on a

518
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,520
seven of swords energy going on right

519
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,520
now for you.

520
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Also,

521
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,080
this is about your social mask falling

522
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:05,320
off.

523
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,320
You see, it all just hit me.

524
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,760
This is your life with your safer

525
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,240
option. This is your social mask that

526
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,440
you put on and act like everything is

527
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,919
just fine. Everything's fine.

528
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,919
Everything's good. Everything's good.

529
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,240
And then this

530
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,039
is the advice

531
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,640
is to exit this cycle of social mask

532
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,520
which doesn't lead to confidence or

533
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,760
healing. I just call judgment on your

534
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,600
seven of swords. A lot of you, yes, this

535
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,760
is seven of swords, judgment on a

536
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,760
scheme, particularly a synchronistic

537
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,760
scheme

538
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:46,960
more. So, this is about it's judgment

539
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,440
day to stop wearing a mask

540
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,679
and to just freaking

541
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,760
six of swords, knight of cups this

542
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,080
situation. At least this is in your

543
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,159
challenge. Why it's in your challenge?

544
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,880
Well,

545
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,880
page of swords.

546
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,200
You've been thinking about it.

547
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,240
You've been thinking about it.

548
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,000
Let's go ahead and clarify this six of

549
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,279
swords. Actually, you know what? Let's

550
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,120
leave that alone. I think we said enough

551
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,720
about that. Um,

552
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,400
let's clarify that nine of cups, that

553
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,000
social mask or that negative

554
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,320
synchronicity or that thing that you

555
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,320
need to jump on the wave of.

556
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,080
Yes, you need to defend your future

557
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,080
right now from something really bad

558
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,080
here.

559
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,919
Seven of swords immediately blocking out

560
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,400
this five of pentacles and you kind of

561
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,159
getting away with all the goods. We have

562
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,480
a lot of really positive cards coming

563
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,039
out right here. So I think it's judgment

564
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,400
day that there needs to be a boundary

565
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,080
put up to whatever this five of

566
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,520
pentacles frequency is. Whenever I show

567
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,360
it to you, what is this frequency when

568
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,120
you when I put it up? What is this to

569
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,679
you? That's the energy that you need to

570
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,360
put up a boundary with in your reality.

571
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,360
Any closing remarks?

572
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,840
Yeah, it's time to admit to the pain

573
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,080
that you're actually in and channel that

574
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,080
potential aggression in order to make

575
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,159
those changes into your life. Channel

576
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,200
your confidence in order to make that

577
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,320
change in your life. So, with that being

578
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,159
said, I'm going to conclude this

579
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,159
reading. Thank you so much. Peace.
