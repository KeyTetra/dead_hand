1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,920
chosen one. You are not here by

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,599
accident. You did not stumble into this

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,440
moment by chance, curiosity, or routine.

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,080
Heaven has ordered this exact

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,160
intersection in time because your spirit

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,880
is ready to hear what is about to be

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,680
released. Something has been stirring

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,240
within you a quiet knowing, a holy

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,279
pressure, a sense that your season is

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,920
shifting, and that is because it is.

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,000
This is divine timing orchestrated

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,760
beyond the visible aligned in the

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,719
unseen. Chosen one, you are standing at

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,879
the edge of a supernatural breakthrough.

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,760
What has been delayed is about to

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,399
accelerate. What was hidden is about to

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,120
surface. What you carried in faith

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,520
through seasons of silence is now being

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,640
answered with movement, provision, and

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,280
elevation. Scripture reminds us that the

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,920
vision awaits an appointed time. And

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,600
though it tries, it will surely come as

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,479
written in Habachok 2:3.

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,000
That appointed time is now pressing into

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,400
your life. Anointed one. This is not

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,280
just about finances. It is about

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,360
assignment. A great transfer of wealth

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,840
is approaching because heaven trusts

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,560
your heart, your integrity, and your

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,119
obedience. God does not release

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,600
resources without purpose. And you have

32
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,320
been prepared for this moment. As you

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,520
listen, let your spirit open. Let

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,640
expectation rise. What follows is not

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,479
information. It is activation. Heaven is

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,520
speaking and your season is changing.

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,159
Chosen one. The signs have been

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,640
surrounding you quietly, persistently,

39
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,280
sometimes so subtle that only your

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,360
spirit could recognize them. Sudden

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,560
opportunities appearing where there were

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,680
none. Unexpected changes disrupting

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,479
routines you once depended on. Doors

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,240
closing without explanation while others

45
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,800
open effortlessly, almost mysteriously.

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,840
These are not random fluctuations of

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,319
life. These are confirmations.

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,520
This is how heaven signals that a season

49
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,520
has ended and another has begun. I have

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,480
lived through this kind of transition

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,440
myself when what once felt stable

52
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,400
started to feel misaligned. When comfort

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,360
began to lose its peace. At the time it

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,640
felt unsettling. But looking back every

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:39,040
closed door was mercy, every disruption

56
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:42,080
was direction. Chosen one, your season

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,239
is shifting. You are stepping into a new

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
realm of abundance, purpose and

59
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,519
responsibility.

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,879
And I want to be very clear with you

61
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,599
because clarity is protection. This is

62
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,840
not only about money. Wealth is simply

63
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,319
the visible expression of something

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,680
deeper that is happening first in the

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,840
unseen. Before anything changes in your

66
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
bank account, your business or your

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,959
resources, something shifts in your

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,920
spirit. This is how it has always

69
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,360
worked. Scripture reminds us that what

70
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,519
is seen was made from what is unseen.

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,239
And so if you are sensing movement

72
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,440
internally, if something in you feels

73
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,000
awakened, restless, expectant, that is

74
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,080
because the transfer has already begun

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,400
at the spiritual level. Chosen one.

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,560
Many people miss this moment because

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,280
they are waiting for physical proof

78
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,840
before they believe. But those who are

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,159
chosen learn to recognize heaven's

80
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,680
movement before the manifestation

81
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,560
arrives.

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,519
I remember a season in my own life where

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,280
nothing on the outside looked promising.

84
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,599
Bills were due, progress was slow. Yet

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,840
inside there was a calm that did not

86
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,640
match the circumstances.

87
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,680
That calm was not denial. It was

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,400
preparation. That is the same peace you

89
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,680
are feeling now. It is the spirit

90
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,080
whispering, "This is temporary. Be

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,920
ready." That inner knowing is not

92
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,479
imagination. It is alignment. One of the

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,440
first signs that the great transfer is

94
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,240
approaching is this unshakable inner

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,639
certainty. You cannot fully explain it

96
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,240
to others. You may not even have words

97
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,400
for it yourself, but deep down you know.

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,440
It feels like standing on the edge of

99
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,080
something significant, something holy.

100
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,240
It is the same kind of knowing described

101
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,240
when the vision waits for its appointed

102
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,680
time written in Habachok 2:3. It does

103
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,320
not rush. It does not panic. It arrives

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,120
exactly when you are ready to carry it.

105
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,080
And chosen one that time is drawing near

106
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,280
for you. Along with this knowing often

107
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,560
comes divine discontent. Things that

108
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,280
once satisfied you no longer do. Work

109
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,479
that once felt meaningful now feels

110
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,360
empty. Conversations that once energized

111
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,560
you now drain you. This can feel

112
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,639
confusing, even painful, especially when

113
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,280
others around you seem comfortable

114
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,360
staying where they are. But hear me

115
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,320
clearly. Discontent is not rebellion. It

116
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,800
is elevation. It is heaven. Loosening

117
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,440
your grip on what cannot go with you

118
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,000
into the next season. I remember having

119
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,800
to walk away from situations that made

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,479
sense on paper but felt wrong in my

121
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:44,160
spirit. At the time it felt like loss.

122
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:47,280
Later I realized it was protection.

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,919
Chosen one. The old must fall away so

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,360
the new can enter. This is not

125
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,400
punishment. It is preparation. Abundance

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,199
requires capacity and capacity is

127
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,840
created by release. That is why you are

128
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,400
being stripped of habits, mindsets, and

129
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,880
even relationships that no longer align

130
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,120
with who you are becoming. This is how

131
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,960
you are prepared to carry wealth with

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,520
wisdom, not desperation. You may also be

133
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,240
noticing patterns and synchronicities

134
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,759
that you cannot ignore. repeating

135
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,000
numbers, timely conversations, messages

136
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,639
that seem to find you at the exact

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,080
moment you need them. These are not

138
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,840
coincidences. They are confirmations.

139
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,240
When you see these alignments,

140
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,280
especially during moments of doubt or

141
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,039
decision, it is heaven saying you are on

142
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,440
the path. Stay alert. Do not obsess over

143
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,240
the signs, but do not dismiss them

144
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,000
either. They are markers, not the

145
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,520
destination.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,360
Another powerful sign is sudden clarity.

147
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,120
Ideas begin to flow. Solutions surface

148
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,280
unexpectedly.

149
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,000
You may wake up with insight about a

150
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,800
problem that has followed you for years.

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,360
These are not random thoughts. These are

152
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,240
instructions. And this is where many

153
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,280
chosen ones hesitate. They wait for the

154
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,199
idea to feel perfect before acting. But

155
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,160
the transfer does not move through

156
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,960
perfection. It moves through obedience.

157
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,080
Write the ideas down. Take the small

158
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,319
steps. The path often reveals itself

159
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,080
only after movement begins. Chosen one,

160
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,280
I want you to hear this with your

161
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,400
spirit, not just your ears. What you are

162
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,800
experiencing right now is not chaos. It

163
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,400
is convergence. Everything you have

164
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,800
lived through, the delays, the

165
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,599
disappointments, the silent prayers are

166
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,840
converging into this moment. And in the

167
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,479
next part, I am going to show you why

168
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,360
the chosen ones are the only ones

169
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,759
trusted to carry this transfer and why

170
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,639
your entire life has been preparing you

171
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,000
for what is about to unfold.

172
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,960
Chosen one, you must understand why this

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,160
transfer is not random and why it is not

174
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,319
falling into just any hands. Heaven does

175
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,560
not release weighty blessings without

176
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,120
first shaping the vessel that will carry

177
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,840
them. And this is where your story

178
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
begins to make sense. The struggles you

179
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,919
endured were not signs of being

180
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,120
overlooked. They were signs of being

181
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,840
trained. The delays were not denials.

182
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,080
They were divine recalibrations.

183
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,399
Everything that once confused you was

184
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,240
quietly preparing you. From the

185
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,399
beginning, you were different. You

186
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,519
noticed it early on. Even if you could

187
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,159
not name it, you never fully blended in.

188
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,440
You questioned things others accepted

189
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,080
blindly. You felt deeply carried empathy

190
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,720
and often bore responsibility that was

191
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,040
heavier than your years. While others

192
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,839
moved through life untouched, you were

193
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,880
pressed, refined, and stretched. That

194
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,680
was not cruelty. That was calling.

195
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,800
Wealth without character destroys, but

196
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,360
wealth with wisdom multiplies. Heaven

197
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,640
has been cultivating wisdom in you long

198
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,399
before resources ever arrived.

199
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,760
Chosen one. Many people want abundance,

200
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,440
but few can sustain it. That is why so

201
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,080
many rise quickly and fall just as fast.

202
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,240
But you have been built differently. You

203
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,959
learned endurance in seasons where

204
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,880
nothing moved. You learned discipline

205
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,519
when you had to stretch little into

206
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,160
enough. You learned humility when

207
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,279
recognition did not come. You learned

208
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,320
faith when logic failed. These lessons

209
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,399
were not optional. They were required.

210
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,440
Because what is coming to you is not

211
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,959
light. It carries weight. And weight

212
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,120
demands strength. I remember a season

213
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,680
when I prayed for increase. Yet

214
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,480
everything around me seemed to shrink.

215
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,320
Opportunities disappeared. Support

216
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,760
faded. At the time it felt like loss but

217
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,000
later I realized something profound. If

218
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,440
the blessing had come then it would have

219
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,839
crushed me. My mind was not ready. My

220
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,800
boundaries were not strong enough. My

221
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,240
discernment was still developing. Heaven

222
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,720
withheld not to punish but to protect

223
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,320
and chosen one. The same was true for

224
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,279
you. This is why you are set apart. You

225
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,760
were not built to chase wealth blindly.

226
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,839
You were shaped to steward it.

227
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,320
Stewardship is not about how much you

228
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,839
have. It is about how you carry

229
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,839
responsibility.

230
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,480
You have always felt the pull to do

231
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,040
things with integrity even when cutting

232
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,519
corners would have been easier. You felt

233
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,720
uneasy when something benefited you at

234
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,160
the expense of others. That sensitivity

235
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,720
is not weakness. It is qualification.

236
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,200
Heaven entrusts resources to those who

237
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,240
can hold them without being consumed by

238
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,720
them. Chosen.

239
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,600
One another reason you are chosen is

240
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,079
your awareness. While many pursue money

241
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,399
as an identity, you understand that

242
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,519
wealth is a tool. You know that

243
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,360
abundance without purpose feels empty.

244
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,240
You have seen people with everything

245
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,959
still feel hollow. That understanding

246
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,839
did not come from books alone. It came

247
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,320
from observation, from disappointment,

248
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,360
from realizing that fulfillment does not

249
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,480
come from possession but from alignment.

250
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,120
This awareness sets you apart. You are

251
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,760
not meant to hoard. You are meant to

252
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,839
channel. This is why you often feel

253
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,399
called to help, to uplift, to

254
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,120
contribute. Even when you had little,

255
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,920
you gave. Even when you were tired, you

256
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,399
showed up. Even when no one noticed, you

257
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,959
stayed faithful. That generosity of

258
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,880
spirit is not accidental. It is the

259
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,440
reason wealth can flow through you

260
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,160
without poisoning you. Heaven does not

261
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,920
release abundance into hands driven by

262
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,720
ego. It releases it into hands shaped by

263
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,279
service. Timing is another critical

264
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,920
reason you are chosen. You are stepping

265
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,639
into a moment in history where old

266
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,519
systems are breaking down. You can see

267
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,639
it everywhere. Institutions once

268
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,440
considered unshakable are trembling.

269
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,320
Economic structures are shifting. What

270
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,040
worked for generations no longer holds.

271
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,240
This is not chaos alone. It is

272
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,600
transition. When old containers crack,

273
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,320
new ones are required. And chosen one.

274
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,440
You are one of those new vessels. The

275
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,240
transfer is not merely financial. It is

276
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,320
spiritual. It is a redistribution of

277
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,920
influence, opportunity and

278
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,880
responsibility.

279
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,839
Resources are moving away from misuse

280
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,959
and toward alignment. That is why you

281
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,760
were trained through scarcity. Scarcity

282
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,200
taught you value. Lack taught you

283
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,440
management. Waiting taught you patience.

284
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,160
These lessons make you the right steward

285
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,560
for what is coming. Your vision also

286
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,519
sets you apart. While others see

287
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,240
obstacles, you see possibilities. Where

288
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,959
others stop, you imagine alternatives.

289
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,600
This is not just creativity. It is

290
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,800
perception. It is the ability to see

291
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,360
beyond the surface into what could be.

292
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,720
Many of the ideas stirring inside you

293
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,360
now are not random. They are previews.

294
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,600
They are seeds. They are glimpses of

295
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,000
what you will soon be called to build,

296
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,440
support, or lead. chosen one. Humility

297
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
has been one of your greatest

298
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,720
protections. Even as you grow, you

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,760
remain teachable. Even as you succeed,

300
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,880
you remain grounded. You ask questions,

301
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,399
you listen, you reflect. Pride shuts

302
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,639
doors. Humility opens them. This posture

303
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,639
has preserved you. It has kept your

304
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,600
heart flexible and your spirit

305
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,800
receptive. And this is why favor follows

306
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,959
you quietly. Courage is another mark.

307
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,680
You have stepped forward when fear told

308
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,480
you to retreat. You have taken risks

309
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,680
others avoided. But your courage is not

310
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,720
reckless. It is rooted in trust. You do

311
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,199
not move blindly. You move prayerfully.

312
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,760
You move thoughtfully. You move with an

313
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,480
inner assurance that you are guided even

314
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,279
when the path is unclear. This balance

315
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,440
is rare and it is necessary for what

316
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,600
lies ahead.

317
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,399
Chosen one.

318
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,199
Your calling is generational. This

319
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,000
transfer is not just about your comfort.

320
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,600
It is about legacy. The decisions you

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,680
will make, the structures you will

322
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,639
build, the resources you will manage

323
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,360
will echo beyond your lifetime. That is

324
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,079
why your preparation has been intense.

325
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,120
You are not being delayed. You are being

326
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,519
fortified. And in the next part, I will

327
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,600
speak to you about the three forces that

328
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,160
determine whether this transfer is

329
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,639
merely received or fully sustained

330
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,880
faith, alignment, and action. Because

331
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,160
what is coming to you must not only

332
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,920
arrive, it must endure.

333
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,320
Chosen one, now we must speak plainly

334
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,800
about what determines whether this great

335
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,600
transfer merely visits your life or

336
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,000
becomes established within it. There are

337
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,720
three forces that must move together in

338
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,360
harmony for the promise to mature fully.

339
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,079
Faith, alignment, and action. These are

340
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,560
not abstract ideas. They are living

341
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,440
principles. When one is missing, the

342
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,560
flow weakens. When all three are active,

343
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,360
the transfer accelerates. Let us begin

344
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,720
with faith because faith is always the

345
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,759
foundation. Faith is not optimism and it

346
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,079
is not denial. Faith is the quiet

347
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,279
confidence that remains steady when

348
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,680
evidence is absent. It is the ability to

349
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,720
stand firm when nothing around you

350
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,600
confirms what you know inside. Many

351
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,079
people think faith is loud declarations,

352
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,560
but true faith is often silent

353
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,360
endurance. It is waking up and

354
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,160
continuing when you feel tired. It is

355
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,360
trusting timing when impatience presses

356
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,320
in. It is holding the vision even when

357
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,399
others misunderstand you.

358
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,720
Chosen one.

359
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,759
You have already been walking by faith

360
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,480
longer than you realize. Every time you

361
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,880
kept going without reassurance, faith

362
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,600
was active. Every time you chose

363
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,920
integrity over shortcuts, faith was

364
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,160
working. Every time you believed there

365
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,959
was more for you while circumstances

366
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,440
said otherwise, faith was shaping you.

367
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,519
This is why you survived seasons that

368
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,240
would have broken others. Faith

369
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,519
sustained you when logic could not. But

370
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,320
hear this clearly. Faith is not passive.

371
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,199
Faith prepares. If you truly believe

372
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,839
rain is coming, you do not stand still.

373
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,520
You prepare the ground. In the same way,

374
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,520
if you believe the transfer is

375
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,199
approaching, you prepare your inner

376
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,600
world. Faith changes how you speak. It

377
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,839
changes how you think. It changes how

378
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,559
you respond to pressure. You stop

379
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,520
speaking in defeat. You stop rehearsing

380
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,960
lack. You stop making decisions rooted

381
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,840
in fear. Faith trains your mind to agree

382
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,480
with what heaven has already decided.

383
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,640
Now let us speak about alignment because

384
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,360
faith without alignment creates

385
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,600
frustration. Alignment is when your

386
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,160
inner beliefs, your daily habits and

387
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,720
your spiritual posture move in the same

388
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,360
direction. Many people pray for

389
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,000
abundance while living in contradiction.

390
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,960
They desire increase but hold on to

391
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,440
scarcity thinking. They ask for more but

392
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,520
mishandle what they already have.

393
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,880
Alignment is the work of bringing

394
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,320
everything into harmony. Chosen one.

395
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,559
Alignment always begins internally. You

396
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,720
cannot attract expansion while your

397
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,360
inner dialogue is still rehearsing

398
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,679
limitation. If you constantly tell

399
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,160
yourself that wealth is for others, that

400
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,320
you always fall short, that nothing ever

401
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,600
works out for you, you are resisting

402
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,880
what you are asking for. These beliefs

403
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,600
act like invisible walls. They do not

404
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,400
stop heaven's ability, but they restrict

405
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,280
your capacity to receive.

406
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:39,440
Replacing these beliefs is not shallow

407
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,919
positivity. It is spiritual realignment.

408
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,960
You are agreeing with truth instead of

409
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:48,080
past wounds. You are choosing to speak

410
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,039
life where fear once lived. When your

411
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,360
words change, your energy shifts. When

412
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,480
your energy shifts, your decisions

413
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,679
change. And when your decisions change,

414
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,840
your reality begins to follow. Alignment

415
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,400
also shows up in how you handle

416
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,480
responsibility. If you are praying for

417
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,120
increase but avoiding discipline,

418
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,320
something is out of order. Stewardship

419
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,960
is spiritual. Managing time, money, and

420
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,160
energy with care is not separate from

421
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,320
prayer. They are connected. Heaven tests

422
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,039
with small things before releasing

423
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,360
larger ones. If you are careless with

424
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,320
little, you will feel overwhelmed by

425
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,720
much. I have seen this repeatedly.

426
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,280
People receive sudden opportunities and

427
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,679
lose them because they lacked structure.

428
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,000
But you chosen one have been trained

429
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,320
differently. You learned to plan when

430
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,039
resources were limited. You learned to

431
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,679
be intentional when options were few.

432
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,640
Those habits matter now. They are signs

433
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,919
of alignment. Timing is another part of

434
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,640
alignment. There is a divine season for

435
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,919
every release. When you try to force

436
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,320
what is not ready, you exhaust yourself.

437
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,679
When you wait beyond your moment, you

438
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,320
miss momentum. Alignment teaches

439
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,520
discernment. It teaches you when to

440
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,600
pause and when to move. And when you are

441
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,000
aligned, you feel peace even in

442
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,360
uncertainty because you trust that what

443
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,200
is meant for you will not pass you by.

444
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,480
Now we come to action, the most

445
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,360
misunderstood pillar. Action is where

446
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,760
faith becomes visible. You can believe

447
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,799
deeply and be perfectly aligned, but

448
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,120
without movement, nothing changes.

449
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,520
Action is the signal that tells heaven

450
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,440
you are ready to participate in what has

451
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,080
been promised.

452
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,679
Chosen one action does not always look

453
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,400
dramatic. Often it begins small.

454
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,600
Researching an idea, making a phone

455
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,000
call, writing a plan, learning a new

456
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,640
skill. These steps may feel

457
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,520
insignificant, but they are powerful.

458
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,919
The universe responds to movement.

459
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,200
Momentum is created when faith steps

460
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,000
forward even before clarity is complete.

461
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,559
Many chosen ones delay action, waiting

462
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,360
for certainty. They say they will move

463
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,000
when fear disappears, when resources

464
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,880
increase, when conditions improve, but

465
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,159
growth does not wait for comfort. The

466
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,880
perfect moment rarely arrives. The path

467
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,880
reveals itself as you walk it. There is

468
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,840
a principle that says faith without

469
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,880
works is lifeless. This does not mean

470
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,520
striving. It means responding. When you

471
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,960
act on what you know even imperfectly,

472
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,760
you activate flow. Doors open after

473
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,480
movement, not before it. Guidance

474
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,679
becomes clearer once you step forward,

475
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,640
not while you remain still. Obedience is

476
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,559
a crucial part of action. Sometimes you

477
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,440
will be prompted to do things that do

478
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,760
not make sense logically. to give when

479
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,559
it feels risky, to leave something

480
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,360
familiar, to pursue an idea that feels

481
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:04,480
too big. These moments are not tests of

482
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,640
intelligence. They are tests of trust.

483
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:11,760
Obedience unlocks what logic cannot.

484
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,960
Chosen one. These three forces are not

485
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,640
separate paths. They are one system.

486
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,159
Faith fuels alignment. Alignment directs

487
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,440
action. Action strengthens faith. When

488
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,080
one weakens, the whole flow slows. But

489
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,960
when all three are active, the transfer

490
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,679
accelerates naturally. I want you to

491
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,679
pause and reflect honestly. Where is

492
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,640
your faith strong but your action

493
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,280
delayed? Where is your action busy but

494
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,120
your alignment of awareness is not

495
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,240
condemnation. It is invitation. Begin

496
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,280
where you are. Strengthen what is weak.

497
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,559
Adjust what is misaligned. Take one

498
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,880
intentional step. In the next part, we

499
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,440
will go deeper into the spiritual and

500
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,760
practical path of receiving wealth.

501
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,280
Because what is coming to you must not

502
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,240
only arrive, it must be sustained.

503
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,799
Chosen one. Now we must speak about the

504
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,679
path itself because wealth does not

505
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,720
arrive randomly and it does not remain

506
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,080
without structure. It flows along a path

507
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,880
that is both spiritual and practical.

508
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,520
Many people lean heavily to one side and

509
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,400
neglect the other. Some are deeply

510
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,120
spiritual but avoid responsibility,

511
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,000
discipline and planning. Others are

512
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,200
practical and ambitious but disconnected

513
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,559
from inner guidance and higher purpose.

514
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,120
Both paths alone are incomplete. What is

515
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,080
coming to you requires balance.

516
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,640
Everything begins in the unseen. Before

517
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,200
wealth takes form in your hands, it must

518
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,960
take shape in your inner world. Your

519
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,280
thoughts, beliefs, and emotional

520
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,919
patterns are not neutral. They are

521
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,480
creative forces. You are constantly

522
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,880
shaping your future by what you allow to

523
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,880
live within you. This is why the

524
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,919
preparation you have been going through

525
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,039
has been so internal. Heaven was not

526
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,799
only changing your circumstances, it was

527
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:17,200
reshaping your inner environment.

528
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,400
Chosen one. Abundance begins with

529
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,200
gratitude. Not forced gratitude. Not

530
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,360
pretending everything is fine, but real

531
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,720
recognition of what has already carried

532
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,159
you this far. Gratitude shifts your

533
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,480
posture from lack to expectancy.

534
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,960
I remember seasons where I had very

535
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,919
little materially. Yet, the moment I

536
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,440
began to genuinely honor what I did,

537
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:46,400
have clarity followed. Not instantly but

538
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,799
steadily. Gratitude does not deny

539
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,679
struggle. It acknowledges provision

540
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,799
within it. And that acknowledgment opens

541
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,120
the door for more. Another spiritual

542
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,840
practice that prepares you for wealth is

543
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,320
vision. You must be able to see yourself

544
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,840
in the life you are being prepared for.

545
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,880
Not in fantasy but in felt reality.

546
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,440
Close your eyes and imagine stability.

547
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,320
Imagine freedom. Imagine having enough

548
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,080
to breathe, to give, to build. Do not

549
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:21,679
just see images. Feel the peace. Feel

550
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,880
the security. Feel the responsibility.

551
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,880
This emotional alignment matters. When

552
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,840
your nervous system becomes familiar

553
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,880
with abundance, you stop sabotaging it

554
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,000
when it arrives. Prayer and stillness

555
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,200
are also essential. Prayer aligns your

556
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,840
desire with divine wisdom. Stillness

557
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,960
allows you to hear guidance that noise

558
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,520
drowns out. Many answers you are seeking

559
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,240
will not come through effort alone. They

560
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,400
will come through listening. I have seen

561
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,000
some of the most important directions

562
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,039
arrive in moments of quiet not urgency.

563
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,159
When you slow down internally, clarity

564
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,720
accelerates externally. Chosen one

565
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,520
giving is another spiritual law that

566
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,400
cannot be bypassed. You cannot receive

567
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,279
freely if you refuse to release. This

568
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,159
does not mean reckless generosity. It

569
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,400
means intentional flow. When you give

570
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,600
with wisdom and an open heart, you

571
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,880
create circulation. Stagnation breaks

572
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:28,240
when flow begins. Holding tightly out of

573
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,559
fear sends a message of mistrust. Giving

574
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,600
from alignment sends a message of

575
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,880
readiness. Forgiveness is also part of

576
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,000
the spiritual path. Unforgiven wounds

577
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,720
drain energy. Resentment ties your

578
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,720
future to your past. I have watched

579
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,799
people delay their own breakthroughs

580
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,080
because they carried old bitterness like

581
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:53,600
a shield, not realizing it was a cage.

582
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,799
Forgiveness is not about excusing harm.

583
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,360
It is about reclaiming your power. When

584
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:02,720
you release what hurt you, you free

585
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,679
space for what is meant to bless you.

586
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,000
Now chosen one, we must speak about the

587
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,880
practical path because spiritual

588
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,919
readiness alone is not enough. Heaven

589
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,600
does not pour abundance into chaos.

590
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,400
Preparation is proof of readiness. Start

591
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,200
with stewardship. How you manage what

592
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,559
you have now reveals how you will manage

593
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,919
more. Even if what you have feels small,

594
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:32,559
treat it with care. Respect creates

595
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,039
increase. Budgeting, planning, tracking,

596
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,760
and intentional spending are not just

597
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,640
financial tools. They are spiritual

598
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,799
disciplines. They teach order. They

599
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,400
teach awareness. They teach

600
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,799
responsibility.

601
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,440
Many people pray for overflow while

602
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,480
living without structure. But structure

603
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,640
is what holds overflow safely. When you

604
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,159
show that you can manage wisely,

605
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:01,039
capacity expands. Education is another

606
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,039
key. Opportunities will come, but

607
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,080
knowledge determines whether you can

608
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,720
sustain them. Learn about money, learn

609
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,840
about business, learn about investing

610
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,000
and systems. You do not need to master

611
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,120
everything overnight, but you must be

612
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,480
willing to grow. Sudden wealth without

613
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,840
understanding often disappears quickly.

614
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:27,600
Preparation preserves what arrives. Your

615
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,080
skills also matter. Wealth often flows

616
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,039
through what you are called to do.

617
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,320
Identify what you are naturally good at.

618
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,960
Develop it. Refine it. Offer it with

619
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,600
excellence. When your work is aligned

620
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,240
with your gifts, provision follows more

621
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,799
naturally. This is not about hustling

622
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,520
endlessly. It is about working in

623
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,080
alignment. Relationships are part of the

624
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,799
practical path as well. The right

625
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,679
connections open doors that effort alone

626
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,320
cannot. Be intentional about who you

627
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,039
allow close. Surround yourself with

628
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,240
people who value growth, integrity, and

629
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:09,360
purpose. Relationships built on mutual

630
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,320
respect and shared values become bridges

631
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,960
for opportunity. The universe often

632
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,480
moves through people. There will also be

633
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,600
moments that require risk. Calculated,

634
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,159
prayerful risk. Growth demands movement

635
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,000
beyond comfort. You may be prompted to

636
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,559
start something, invest or shift

637
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,200
direction. Fear will speak loudly in

638
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,559
these moments. But fear is not a

639
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,240
reliable guide. Discernment is seek

640
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:41,919
wisdom then move. Remaining stagnant

641
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,960
guarantees nothing changes. Balance is

642
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,279
the key chosen one. Spiritual alignment

643
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,320
without action creates waiting without

644
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,880
manifestation. Action without spiritual

645
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,240
grounding creates exhaustion without

646
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,360
fulfillment. When you combine both, flow

647
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,919
begins. You move with purpose instead of

648
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,559
pressure. You act with clarity instead

649
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,760
of anxiety. Persistence will be

650
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,399
required. The path is rarely linear.

651
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,880
There will be setbacks, delays,

652
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:16,000
adjustments. These are not signs of

653
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,480
failure. They are refinements. Seeds do

654
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,919
not sprout the day they are planted.

655
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,880
Trust the process. Stay consistent. Stay

656
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:28,080
grounded. Keep your motives clean.

657
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,120
Wealth is a tool, not an identity. If

658
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,440
your focus becomes ego or comparison,

659
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,000
the flow weakens. But when your

660
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,720
intention remains service, freedom and

661
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,320
impact, provision continues to increase.

662
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,320
Chosen one. The steps you take now are

663
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,480
shaping the container that will hold

664
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,600
what is coming. This is not about

665
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,520
rushing. It is about readiness. Walk

666
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,720
faithfully in the unseen. Act wisely in

667
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,600
the scene. When both paths merge, you

668
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,440
become a stable vessel for abundance.

669
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,399
And in the next part, I will speak to

670
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,720
you about why now is the appointed time

671
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,679
and why everything you are witnessing in

672
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,799
the world and in your life confirms that

673
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,799
this moment has arrived.

674
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,440
Chosen one.

675
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,240
Now we must speak about timing because

676
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,520
timing is everything. You may have asked

677
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,399
yourself many times, why now? Why after

678
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,039
all these years? Why not earlier when I

679
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,360
was struggling the most? These are not

680
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,159
wrong questions. They are human

681
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,799
questions and they deserve an honest

682
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,559
grounded answer. What you are stepping

683
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:45,039
into is not delayed. It is appointed.

684
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,840
And an appointed time does not arrive

685
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,399
when it is convenient. It arrives when

686
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,720
alignment is complete. Everything

687
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,840
happening in your life right now is part

688
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,000
of a larger design. This message

689
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,360
reaching you at this moment is not

690
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,159
coincidence. It is confirmation.

691
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,600
We are living in a season of transition.

692
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,399
Not only personally but globally.

693
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,679
Systems that once appeared stable are

694
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,000
cracking. Economic models, institutions,

695
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,559
and structures that people relied on for

696
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,840
security are shifting. This is not

697
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:25,760
simply chaos. It is exposure. What was

698
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:29,120
built on imbalance cannot hold forever.

699
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,919
Chosen one. The shaking you see in the

700
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,640
world is the same shaking you once felt

701
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,799
internally. Before your life began to

702
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,480
change, something in you had to be

703
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:43,120
unsettled. Old beliefs were challenged.

704
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,600
Comfort zones collapsed. Certainty

705
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,200
faded. At the time it felt

706
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,159
destabilizing.

707
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,720
Now you can see it was preparation. The

708
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,159
same pattern is unfolding on a larger

709
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,480
scale. The old era is losing its grip

710
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,679
and space is being made for something

711
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,799
new. There is a principle that says when

712
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,919
what is misaligned is shaken only what

713
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,799
is true remains. That is what is

714
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,240
happening now. Resources are being

715
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,399
repositioned. Influence is shifting.

716
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,600
Opportunities are moving toward those

717
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:22,640
who can carry them responsibly. This is

718
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,600
the environment where transfer occurs.

719
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,760
Not in comfort, but in transition.

720
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,240
Chosen one.

721
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,960
Many spiritual teachings have spoken of

722
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,159
a season when those who endured quietly

723
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,480
would be elevated openly. A time when

724
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,159
what was stored up would be released

725
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,720
suddenly. This is not mythology. It is

726
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,200
pattern. You may have heard the phrase

727
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,840
that the wealth of the unjust is laid up

728
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,640
for the righteous. But that statement is

729
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,600
not about morality alone. It is about

730
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,960
stewardship. Resources move toward

731
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,440
alignment. Look at your own life. Notice

732
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,159
how things have been rearranging.

733
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,120
Relationships ended that once defined

734
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,000
you. Paths closed that you thought were

735
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,800
permanent. Directions shifted without

736
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,879
warning. These were not punishments.

737
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,760
They were repositionings.

738
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,320
You were being moved into place. Like

739
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,800
pieces on a board. Every move was

740
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,760
intentional. You may not have seen the

741
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,919
full picture, but the strategist did. I

742
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,200
remember a time when multiple things

743
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,560
fell apart at once. Work, relationships,

744
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:37,359
plans. It felt like loss stacked on

745
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,679
loss. Only later did I realize that

746
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,240
staying where I was would have limited

747
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,240
what I was meant to carry next. What

748
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,639
felt like collapse was actually

749
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,159
extraction. I was being pulled out of

750
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,560
something too small for what was ahead.

751
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,440
Chosen one. You have lived through a

752
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,240
similar extraction. Another reason now

753
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,359
is the appointed time is collective

754
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,200
readiness. Over the past few years,

755
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,680
something has shifted in human

756
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,480
consciousness. People are questioning

757
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,560
systems that once went unchallenged.

758
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,280
They are seeking meaning beyond

759
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,560
survival. They are becoming aware that

760
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,640
wealth without purpose leaves emptiness.

761
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,839
This awakening creates a different

762
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:25,280
environment. When consciousness rises,

763
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,280
new forms of abundance become possible.

764
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,000
This is why you may have noticed an

765
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,920
increase in your own sensitivity.

766
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,320
Stronger intuition, vivid dreams, a

767
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,040
deeper awareness of energy timing and

768
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,599
alignment. These are not random

769
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,079
developments. They are signs that the

770
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:47,440
boundary between the unseen and the seen

771
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,400
is thinner. Now guidance is clearer.

772
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,800
Instruction is more direct. Those who

773
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,040
are listening receive advantage.

774
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,839
Acceleration is another marker of

775
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,640
appointed time. In earlier seasons,

776
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:04,000
progress was slow. Effort yielded

777
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,320
little. Now movement happens faster.

778
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,079
Conversations lead to opportunities

779
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,560
quickly. Ideas gain traction sooner.

780
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,760
Decisions create momentum instead of

781
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,640
resistance. This is not coincidence. It

782
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,280
is compression. Time feels faster

783
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,920
because preparation is complete. The

784
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,280
seeds you planted years ago are reaching

785
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,760
maturity. Not just financial seeds, but

786
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,960
seeds of discipline, integrity,

787
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,520
patience, and resilience. You sowed when

788
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,480
nothing seemed to grow. You remained

789
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,280
faithful when no reward was visible.

790
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,320
That sewing did not disappear. It was

791
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,440
stored. And now it is being released in

792
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,480
concentrated form. You may still wonder

793
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,599
why the waiting lasted so long. The

794
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,520
answer is readiness. If abundance had

795
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,079
arrived before your inner world

796
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,960
stabilized, it would have magnified

797
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,359
insecurity. If influence had arrived

798
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,880
before humility settled, it would have

799
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:10,240
amplified ego. Timing protects both the

800
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,000
blessing and the bearer. Delay was not

801
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:17,359
rejection. It was refinement. Chosen

802
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,400
one. There is also a global dimension to

803
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:23,760
this moment. Old economic systems built

804
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,720
on exploitation are being exposed. This

805
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,000
exposure creates instability, but it

806
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:33,280
also creates opportunity. New structures

807
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,920
must be built. New leaders must rise.

808
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,720
New stewards are required. Those

809
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,280
stewards are not chosen randomly. They

810
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,000
are chosen through endurance. This is

811
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,560
why you were trained in isolation. Why

812
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,119
you learned to stand alone. Why you

813
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,160
became self-aware instead of dependent

814
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,400
on external validation. While others

815
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,040
chased shortcuts, you learned

816
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,920
principles. While others relied on

817
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,720
systems, you learned adaptability.

818
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,280
These traits are essential. Now you are

819
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,560
being called not just to receive but to

820
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,000
help build what comes next to invest

821
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,800
wisely to create ethically to lead

822
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,200
responsibly. The wealth coming to you is

823
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,240
not only personal provision it is

824
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,079
building material and your past prepared

825
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,200
you to handle it without losing

826
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:28,160
yourself. Favor is another confirmation

827
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,760
of timing. You may notice help arriving

828
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,320
unexpectedly.

829
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,880
support showing up without request.

830
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,920
Doors opening with little effort. This

831
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,480
is not luck. It is alignment. When

832
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,680
timing meets readiness, resistance

833
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,800
decreases. Chosen one. The appointed

834
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,839
time is not approaching. It has arrived.

835
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,560
The signs are everywhere. In the world,

836
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:56,079
in your life, in your spirit. The

837
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:59,119
restlessness you feel is not anxiety. It

838
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,480
is anticipation. Something old has

839
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,400
ended. Something new is beginning. In

840
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,960
the next part, we will speak about

841
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,240
warnings and wisdom because what is

842
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:13,599
entrusted must be protected. Blessing

843
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,560
requires vigilance and wisdom ensures

844
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,520
what arrives remains.

845
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,160
Chosen one, as this great transfer

846
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,240
begins to move closer to your life, it

847
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,200
is essential that we speak not only

848
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,200
about promise but about protection.

849
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,800
Blessings do not arrive without

850
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,680
responsibility.

851
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,000
Increase demands awareness. What is

852
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,880
coming to you is valuable and anything

853
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,599
of value must be guarded with wisdom.

854
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,079
This is not a message of fear. It is a

855
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,560
message of preparation so that what is

856
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,040
released into your hands can remain

857
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,359
there and multiply.

858
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,240
The first area that requires vigilance

859
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,800
is your inner posture. Wealth has a way

860
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,320
of amplifying what already exists within

861
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,119
a person. If humility is rooted in you,

862
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,640
abundance will expand generosity,

863
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:09,839
clarity, and purpose. But if ego is left

864
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,560
unchecked, wealth will magnify pride,

865
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,040
impatience, and recklessness.

866
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,680
This is why your character was refined

867
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,240
before your resources increased. You

868
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,280
were trained through obscurity to remain

869
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,880
grounded. Do not abandon that posture

870
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,079
now. Ego is subtle. It rarely announces

871
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,480
itself. It whispers instead. It tells

872
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,040
you that you no longer need counsel,

873
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,839
that you earned everything alone, that

874
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,680
correction is unnecessary. These

875
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,240
thoughts are dangerous because they

876
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,560
separate you from guidance. Everything

877
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,280
flowing to you has a source beyond your

878
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,320
effort. Remembering that truth keeps you

879
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,280
aligned. Gratitude protects you.

880
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,920
Humility preserves you. Discernment is

881
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,440
the next safeguard. As your life

882
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,800
expands, so will your visibility. As

883
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,200
resources increase, so will attention.

884
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,839
Not every opportunity presented to you

885
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,839
will be aligned with your purpose. Not

886
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,800
every person who approaches you will

887
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,160
have clean motives. Some will be drawn

888
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:20,319
to what you carry, not who you are. This

889
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:23,839
is not cynicism. It is realism. Chosen

890
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:26,240
one, learn to pause before deciding.

891
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,680
Learn to sit with an offer instead of

892
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,079
rushing into it. Discernment grows in

893
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,400
stillness. When something feels

894
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,000
pressured, urgent, or emotionally

895
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,440
manipulative, step back. True alignment

896
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
does not demand haste. It brings peace

897
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,400
even when it stretches you. Your

898
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,520
intuition will sharpen as you continue

899
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,920
to practice stillness and reflection.

900
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,720
Trust it. Boundaries are another

901
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,599
essential form of wisdom. Your heart is

902
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,240
generous by nature. You feel called to

903
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,560
help to give to uplift. This is

904
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,200
beautiful. But generosity without

905
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,280
boundaries becomes depletion. Not

906
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,839
everyone is ready to receive what you

907
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,040
offer. Giving to those who refuse

908
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:16,160
responsibility can drain your energy and

909
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,200
derail your assignment. Empowerment and

910
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,599
enabling are not the same. Wisdom knows

911
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,920
the difference. Protect your time as

912
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,119
carefully as you protect your money.

913
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,760
Energy is currency. Attention is

914
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,480
currency. Where you invest them

915
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,119
determines what grows. You are not

916
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,280
required to be available to everyone.

917
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:41,119
You are responsible for stewarding

918
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,240
yourself well. Rest is not laziness.

919
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,240
Privacy is not selfishness. Boundaries

920
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,040
are not rejection. They are

921
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,599
preservation. Stewardship must also be

922
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,800
addressed clearly. What is coming to you

923
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,680
is more than finances. It is influence,

924
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,240
responsibility and reach. Without

925
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,359
systems, even the greatest blessing can

926
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,960
slip away. Learn to plan. Learn to

927
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,880
organize. Learn to seek wise counsel.

928
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,319
This does not mean outsourcing your

929
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,319
authority. It means honoring wisdom.

930
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,800
Surround yourself with advisers who

931
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:20,240
align with your values, not just your

932
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,960
ambition. Comparison is another quiet

933
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,760
threat. In a world saturated with

934
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,319
curated success, it is easy to measure

935
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,200
your journey against others. But your

936
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,000
assignment is unique. Your timing is

937
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,800
specific. The form your blessing takes

938
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,280
will not mirror anyone else's.

939
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,720
Comparison creates pressure that leads

940
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,599
to poor decisions. Stay in your lane.

941
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,280
Focus on your path. When you honor your

942
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,720
own process, growth remains steady. Fear

943
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,520
disguised as caution is another trap. As

944
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,400
you expand, voices will rise, some

945
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,599
external, some internal warning you to

946
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,280
play small. While wisdom encourages

947
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,240
discernment, fear encourages retreat.

948
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,880
Learn to distinguish between the two.

949
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,839
Wisdom invites evaluation, then

950
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,800
movement. Fear invites delay,

951
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,440
hesitation, and shrinking. You were not

952
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,720
prepared to hide. You were prepared to

953
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,440
lead. Maintaining spiritual practices

954
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:29,040
becomes even more important as success

955
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,520
increases. When life becomes busy, it is

956
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,720
tempting to abandon what once grounded

957
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,240
you. Prayer, reflection, journaling,

958
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,720
gratitude.

959
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,920
These are not optional habits. They are

960
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,839
anchors. Many lose clarity after their

961
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,800
breakthrough because they stopped doing

962
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:50,000
what kept them aligned. Do not make that

963
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,599
mistake. Stay rooted as you rise.

964
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,319
Privacy is also wisdom. Not every plan

965
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,280
needs to be announced. Not every victory

966
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,760
needs to be shared. Noise invites

967
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,960
interference. Move quietly when

968
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:08,079
necessary. Let results speak. This is

969
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,520
not secrecy born of fear, but strategy

970
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,640
born of maturity. Security often grows

971
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,200
in silence. Legacy thinking is another

972
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,520
essential lens for this season. The

973
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,480
wealth being transferred to you is not

974
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,200
only for immediate enjoyment. It is for

975
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,000
sustainability, for family, for

976
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,200
community, for impact beyond your

977
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,240
lifetime. Ask yourself not just what you

978
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,000
can gain but what you can build. This

979
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:41,440
mindset transforms decisions. It shifts

980
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,400
focus from consumption to cultivation.

981
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,200
Never lose sight of purpose. Wealth is a

982
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,319
tool, not an identity. It does not

983
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,560
define you. It amplifies you. If your

984
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,599
focus remains service impact and

985
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:59,200
alignment, the flow will continue. If

986
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,200
purpose is lost, stagnation follows.

987
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,000
Regularly ask yourself whether your

988
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:07,680
choices align with your calling. This

989
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,520
question keeps you centered. Chosen one,

990
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,160
you have endured too much to be

991
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,119
careless. Now this season requires

992
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,160
balance. Authority with humility,

993
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,800
boldness with discernment, generosity

994
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,200
with wisdom. When these are held

995
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,599
together, protection is established

996
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,480
around your blessing. The warnings

997
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,280
shared here are not restrictions. They

998
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,680
are safeguards. They exist to ensure

999
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,480
that what arrives does not depart

1000
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,520
prematurely. You are not only meant to

1001
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,560
receive. You are meant to sustain, grow,

1002
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,800
and multiply. And in the next and final

1003
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,880
part, we will bring this journey to

1004
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,520
completion, anchoring everything you

1005
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,400
have received into a clear closing and

1006
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,920
call forward so you can step fully into

1007
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,440
what has been prepared for you. Chosen

1008
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,359
one.

1009
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,160
You have walked through this message for

1010
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:04,560
a reason. If you are still here, it is

1011
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,280
because something within you recognizes

1012
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:10,400
truth when it is spoken. This was not

1013
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,480
entertainment. This was alignment. Every

1014
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,960
word you have heard has been stirring

1015
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,760
what was already placed inside you long

1016
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,079
before this moment. And now we come to

1017
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,640
the closing not as an ending but as a

1018
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,599
commissioning. You now understand why

1019
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,240
your life unfolded the way it did. The

1020
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:31,119
struggle was not meaningless. The delays

1021
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,839
were not accidental. The isolation was

1022
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,319
not rejection. Everything you endured

1023
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,480
shaped your capacity, refined your

1024
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:41,359
discernment, and strengthened your

1025
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,240
spirit. You were not being punished. You

1026
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:47,680
were being prepared. And preparation

1027
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:50,000
always precedes release. Look at how far

1028
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,680
you have come. There were seasons when

1029
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,319
you did not think you would make it

1030
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,720
through. Moments when doubt whispered

1031
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,960
louder than hope. Times when you

1032
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,560
questioned your worth, your direction,

1033
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:06,480
even your faith. Yet here you are, still

1034
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:09,680
standing, still seeking, still open.

1035
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,760
That persistence was not random. It

1036
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,359
positioned you.

1037
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:18,480
Chosen one. The great transfer of wealth

1038
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,200
is not just an external event. It is an

1039
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,760
internal shift that expresses itself

1040
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,000
outwardly. You are stepping into a

1041
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,640
season where provision meets purpose,

1042
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,520
where resources meet responsibility,

1043
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,599
where increase meets integrity. This is

1044
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,839
not about sudden riches without

1045
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,880
structure. It is about sustained

1046
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:41,200
abundance backed by wisdom. This wealth

1047
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,480
is coming to you because heaven trusts

1048
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,960
you. Trust is not given lightly. It is

1049
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,680
earned through faithfulness in unseen

1050
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,079
seasons. Through obedience when no one

1051
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,319
was watching, through humility when

1052
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,240
recognition did not come, through

1053
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,800
discipline when shortcuts were

1054
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,599
available. You proved yourself ready

1055
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,160
long before you realized it. Now hear

1056
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,800
this clearly. What is coming to you will

1057
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,920
require your participation. Blessing

1058
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,119
does not override choice. Alignment must

1059
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,319
be maintained. Faith must be practiced.

1060
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,440
Action must continue. The flow responds

1061
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:22,400
to movement. Do not retreat into fear as

1062
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,280
things begin to change. Change is

1063
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,599
confirmation, not threat. You may feel

1064
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,800
moments of uncertainty as your life

1065
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:34,079
expands. That is natural. Growth

1066
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,160
stretches capacity. But remember this,

1067
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,960
you are not stepping into something

1068
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,520
unfamiliar. You are stepping into what

1069
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,000
you were trained for. Every lesson you

1070
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,720
learned will now serve you. Every

1071
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,079
boundary you developed will protect you.

1072
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,559
Every insight you gained will guide you.

1073
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,800
Chosen one. This season will ask you to

1074
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:57,440
rise in ways you have never had to

1075
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,880
before. To make decisions that carry

1076
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,280
weight. to lead with clarity, to steward

1077
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,079
with wisdom. But you will not be doing

1078
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,359
this alone. Guidance will continue to

1079
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:12,240
come. Doors will continue to open.

1080
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:15,520
Support will appear when needed. Stay

1081
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:18,800
attentive. Stay grounded. Remember the

1082
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,760
balance. Stay humble as you rise. Stay

1083
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:24,160
disciplined as resources increase. Stay

1084
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,599
spiritually connected as life becomes

1085
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:30,880
busier. Stay generous but wise. Stay

1086
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:33,200
bold but discerning. This balance is

1087
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,920
your strength. It will keep you steady

1088
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,920
while everything around you expands.

1089
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,520
This wealth is not only for your

1090
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,240
comfort. It is for impact, for freedom,

1091
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,640
for building something that lasts, for

1092
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,119
uplifting others, for creating

1093
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,359
opportunities where there were none, for

1094
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,880
breaking cycles that have limited

1095
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,760
generations.

1096
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,400
You are not just receiving for yourself.

1097
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,000
You are carrying something forward.

1098
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,119
There will be moments when you are

1099
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,839
tempted to look back, to doubt, to

1100
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,480
question whether you are truly ready.

1101
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:11,440
When those moments come, return to what

1102
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,680
you know. You survived what was meant to

1103
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,359
break you. You learned what others

1104
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:20,480
avoided. You endured what refined you.

1105
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:23,839
That did not happen by chance.

1106
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:26,400
chosen one. The season you are entering

1107
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:29,520
will reveal who is aligned to walk with

1108
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,839
you and who must remain behind. Let this

1109
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,880
happen without resentment, without

1110
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:37,280
guilt, without fear. What is leaving is

1111
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,640
making room. What is arriving is

1112
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:43,280
aligned. Trust the rearrangement. As you

1113
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:47,040
move forward, continue to listen.

1114
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:50,400
Continue to grow. Continue to act. Small

1115
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:53,440
steps taken consistently create massive

1116
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,400
shifts over time. Do not underestimate

1117
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,720
obedience in ordinary moments. Many

1118
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,440
breakthroughs are born there. I want you

1119
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,160
to take a moment now wherever you are

1120
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,359
and breathe deeply. Let the weight of

1121
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,400
this message settle. Let gratitude rise

1122
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:12,800
for what has been and expectancy rise

1123
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,760
for what is coming. You do not need to

1124
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,760
rush. You do not need to strive. You

1125
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,280
simply need to stay aligned and

1126
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,000
responsive. Chosen one, this is your

1127
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,319
time. Not because you are perfect, but

1128
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,400
because you are prepared, not because

1129
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:31,040
you are better than others, but because

1130
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,680
you were willing to be shaped. The great

1131
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,400
transfer of wealth is not approaching.

1132
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:40,079
It is already unfolding around you.

1133
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,319
Stand tall. Walk forward. Carry what has

1134
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,119
been entrusted to you with wisdom,

1135
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:47,839
courage, and grace. You are not late.

1136
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,240
You are not behind. You are exactly

1137
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,880
where you need to be. The only thing

1138
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,680
left now is for you to step into it

1139
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,119
fully without fear.

1140
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,520
Chosen one. Take a moment and let your

1141
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,319
spirit settle into what has just been

1142
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,800
released. This is not the end of a

1143
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:09,680
message. This is the ceiling of an

1144
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,160
appointment. What heaven has spoken over

1145
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:15,119
you is already in motion. And nothing

1146
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,920
meant for you can miss you in this hour.

1147
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,400
You are standing in your chyros moment,

1148
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:23,119
the exact time ordained for your

1149
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:26,559
elevation, your alignment, and your

1150
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:29,520
increase. Anointed one, the great

1151
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,240
transfer of wealth is not a burden. It

1152
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,319
is a sacred trust. And you have been

1153
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,280
chosen because your heart has been

1154
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:39,839
refined. Your faith has been tested and

1155
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,200
your spirit has remained teachable.

1156
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:45,760
Remain discerning. Guard your space.

1157
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,480
Stay anchored in the practices that kept

1158
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,640
you steady when the ground was shaking.

1159
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,480
Do not allow the noise of the world to

1160
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,440
pull you out of alignment with what

1161
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,319
heaven is doing through you. I declare

1162
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,200
peace over your mind, clarity over your

1163
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:04,000
decisions, and favor over every step

1164
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:07,119
ahead. What was delayed is now

1165
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,079
accelerating. What was hidden is now

1166
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:13,040
coming into view. Walk forward with

1167
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:16,640
gratitude knowing the divine has already

1168
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:19,280
gone before you and prepared the way. If

1169
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,680
this word resonated with your spirit,

1170
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,800
you may mark this moment with a simple

1171
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,280
declaration below or quietly share it

1172
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,480
with another chosen soul who needs

1173
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:34,640
confirmation. Stay faithful, stay

1174
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,960
aligned, and rise without fear. This is

1175
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,960
your
