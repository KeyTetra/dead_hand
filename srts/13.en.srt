1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,359
Chosen one, hear this urgent call. Your

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,400
awakening is no accident. God has a

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,120
divine plan for you. In this sacred

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,920
moment, hidden forces are watching

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,880
closely. They want to silence your

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,760
voice, distract your journey and dim

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,480
your light. It's time to embrace the

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,760
power of your silence. This is your

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,480
shield against negativity and doubt.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,120
Guard your spirit fiercely. When you

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,920
practice discretion, you align with

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,160
God's will. Your strength lies in

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,440
knowing when to speak and when to be

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,719
still. In silence, you'll discover a

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,160
wellspring of divine revelations.

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,760
Soon, you will experience a breakthrough

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,399
[music] that transforms your path.

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,600
Together, we'll navigate this unseen

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,640
battle with courage and clarity. Like

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,359
and comment 77 to align with this

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,720
transmission. The truth will set you

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,040
free. Stay until the end for this

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,320
message will change everything you

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,680
thought you knew. Chosen ones, listen

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,640
closely. The time is now for divine

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,600
revelation. God is calling you out of

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,880
silence into understanding.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,840
Life seems heavy, does it not? The

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,439
burdens weigh upon your spirit, casting

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,960
shadows deep. You feel it in your heart.

31
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,400
This yearning for clarity. Yet know

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,200
this. Your isolation is not mere chance.

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,799
It is a sacred wilderness designed by

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,560
the Lord. In this wilderness, God molds

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,520
you much like clay in his hand. A new

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,720
identity is rising. One crafted through

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,000
trials and solitude. Reflect on the

38
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,040
moments you felt abandoned. Those heavy

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,240
nights wrapped in loneliness were not

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,119
without purpose. They were designed by a

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,759
God who sees you. Each tear was a

42
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,360
testament. Each silence a whisper of

43
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,400
grace. Just as Job endured his trials

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,040
without understanding. You too are in

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,080
divine training. Those feelings of

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,879
rejection are not the end. They are the

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,800
beginning of something profound. The

48
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,680
Lord has turned your pain into a

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,120
confirmation of your calling. Like

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,319
flames refining gold, your soul is being

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,959
purified through this fire. This agony

52
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,760
is your blessing in disguise, hidden

53
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,200
behind the veils of suffering. You are

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,599
not alone in this journey of revelation.

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,640
Many prophets walked this path of

56
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,599
uncertainty before you. Like David

57
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,319
before Goliaths, they faced overwhelming

58
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,040
odds, yet triumphed through divine

59
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,080
support. Your trials echo their

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,760
struggles, woven into the fabric of your

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,560
destiny. The loneliness was a stage set

62
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,200
for God's power to shine through you.

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,319
What felt unbearable has now become the

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,560
very proof of your purpose. The Lord is

65
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,519
giving you a crown forged from the

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,959
challenges you endured. You must embrace

67
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,519
this truth. Rejection was God's divine

68
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,640
acceptance of your mission. You are

69
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,799
chosen and this is only the beginning of

70
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,280
your journey. Look around, dear ones.

71
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,319
God speaks in subtle signs all around

72
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,680
you. Dreams that flicker like distant

73
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,400
stars. Deja vu moments that awaken your

74
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,360
spirit. Have you noticed the numbers

75
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,519
appearing in your life? Each occurrence

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,560
carries a profound message from the

77
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,440
divine. Every synchronicity is an

78
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,799
invitation to deeper understanding. A

79
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,680
gentle nudge from him. God is not

80
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,120
silent. He whispers through the fabric

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,319
of your reality. Hold on to these signs

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,879
as they guide you forward in faith. They

83
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,080
illuminate the path laid before you,

84
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,200
urging you onward in trust and hope.

85
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,680
Your intuition is more than a feeling.

86
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,239
It is God's divine whisper in your

87
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,800
spirit. The moments when clarity breaks

88
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,560
through confusion are his touch upon

89
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,600
your soul. Trust this inner voice. It is

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,479
the Lord leading you into the light. If

91
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,199
you feel an urge to choose, know that it

92
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,400
is his hand at work. Discern the

93
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,520
stillness as wisdom guiding you through

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,080
the chaos. Each time you pause and

95
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,120
listen, the divine confirms your

96
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,280
direction. This divine confirmation

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,639
strengthens your spirit for what lies

98
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,440
ahead. Trust in these moments. They are

99
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,800
sacred bridges to your [music] destiny.

100
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Every choice, every decision is infused

101
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,479
with a promise from God. Awareness

102
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,440
grows, igniting your spirit beneath the

103
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,160
weight of divine light. As the fog

104
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,880
lifts, you begin to see the truth of

105
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,600
your journey. Those wounds you carry

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,960
transform into testimonies of hope and

107
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,000
resilience. Your scars become symbols of

108
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,199
survival, marks of the painful education

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,360
bestowed by the Lord. Each struggle is a

110
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,800
thread in the tapestry of your life

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,840
story. Embrace this awakening. It

112
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,400
heralds the dawn of your purpose. Know

113
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,360
that your voice will rise from the ashes

114
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,600
of doubt, lighting the way for others.

115
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,720
It is through your journey that you will

116
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,759
guide souls seeking refuge. A new

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,520
identity bears itself before you cloaked

118
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,400
in divine authority. This revelation is

119
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,919
not meant to dwell in the shadows. It is

120
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,800
a call to action. With each realization

121
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:04,000
comes empowerment, igniting the fire

122
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,360
within your soul. The trials you faced

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
have unleashed a warrior of God. If this

124
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,600
resonates deeply with you, do not walk

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,639
away just yet. Stay with me for what is

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,680
to come will change everything. Your

127
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,639
silence has concealed a powerful gift,

128
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,280
one that now demands to be shared.

129
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,080
Comment below with the words, "I carry

130
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,039
the silence as a crown." Let your

131
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,919
declaration echo into the universe as a

132
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,319
bold affirmation of your path. But what

133
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,520
if I told you that what you thought was

134
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,120
abandonment was in truth God's

135
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,000
initiation?

136
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,039
Each moment of sorrow, each feeling of

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,080
neglect is a prelude to your divine

138
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,560
unveiling. The threads of your story are

139
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,680
intricately woven, waiting for the right

140
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,520
moment to reveal their design. As you

141
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,400
stand on the threshold of

142
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,240
transformation, I invite you to breathe

143
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,120
in anticipation,

144
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,199
a divine promise awaits, one that

145
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,639
extends far beyond your current

146
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,199
understanding. Next, I will unveil the

147
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,160
hidden code he left for you, waiting

148
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,240
just beyond this threshold. What grows

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,400
from this moment could weave together

150
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,080
the tapestry of your surrender and

151
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,639
awakening. The journey continues and God

152
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,720
is not finished speaking yet. You

153
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,680
thought you were abandoned, but this

154
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,400
abandonment is a divine law shaping your

155
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,160
destiny. You are not alone in your

156
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,800
suffering. My dear, every chosen one has

157
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,440
walked through this valley of shadows.

158
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,520
This pain weaves a thread through time,

159
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,960
connecting your heart to a greater

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,520
tapestry. God has allowed this silence

161
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,199
for it is here you find strength beyond

162
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,360
measure. In those moments of isolation,

163
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,479
you were not forgotten, but being

164
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,039
prepared for your mission. Like a seed

165
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,000
buried in the dark earth, you are being

166
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,800
fashioned into something mighty. This

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,759
challenge feeds the fire within you,

168
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,879
igniting your spirit to rise. Remember

169
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,520
the trials of those before you. Their

170
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,240
struggles are echoes resonating through

171
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,720
your existence, guiding you towards the

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,759
light of your calling. You are the

173
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,160
phoenix rising from the ashes, crafted

174
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,479
through trials that feel heavier than

175
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,919
stone. Each wound, each scar, narrates a

176
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,959
story of divine intervention and grace.

177
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,560
The desert, though barren, holds the

178
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,959
promise of life and rebirth. God allows

179
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,080
these moments of hardship to transform

180
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,040
you into his vessel of light. You stand

181
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,760
now at the crossroads chosen for a

182
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,560
purpose deeper than your current vision.

183
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,600
As you traverse this path, know that it

184
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,160
mirrors the journey of every great soul.

185
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,200
It is the eternal truth that the fire

186
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,399
refineses gold and you are destined to

187
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,440
shine. Your tribulations are not in

188
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,880
vain. They sculpt your spirit into one

189
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,000
that can endure. In darkness, the roots

190
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,800
of your tree grow deeper, anchoring you

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,279
to divine love. You are part of a

192
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,880
lineage that has birthed heroes. And

193
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,040
within you lies the same potential. Like

194
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,440
Moses leading his people through the

195
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,560
wilderness, you are being guided by

196
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,839
faith. The bitter waters you face will

197
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,440
become sweet. For God is a master of

198
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,920
transformation.

199
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,160
Each experience of rejection is the

200
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,760
Lord's way of aligning you with your

201
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,640
true destiny. Think of Joseph cast into

202
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,760
the pit yet destined for greatness in

203
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,399
Egypt. You may feel alone, but his

204
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,600
spirit wraps around you, lighting the

205
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,560
path ahead. As you journey, remember

206
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,160
that Christ himself tasted rejection and

207
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,440
isolation for your sake. He rose again

208
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,480
and so shall you. This pain you endure

209
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,040
is a crucible. Each trial strengthens

210
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,000
your resolve, molding you into the

211
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,959
leader you are meant to be. You walk a

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,839
line of divine intention, echoing the

213
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,279
path laid before you in scripture.

214
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,640
Isolation precedes elevation. This is

215
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,440
the sacred law whispered by the heavens

216
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,000
like clouds gathering before the rain.

217
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,519
Darkness often precedes the birth of

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,480
light. God does not abandon. He

219
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,760
prepares, molding you for a purpose that

220
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,399
is yet to unfold. Closed doors shield

221
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,279
you from distractions, guiding you to

222
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,440
the sacred path ahead. Your silence

223
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,160
speaks louder than the noise of the

224
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,880
world around you. The Lord watches over

225
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,040
your journey as you traverse this sacred

226
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,680
terrain. Understand chosen one that in

227
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,880
moments of stillness he is working

228
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,120
behind the scenes elevation comes not

229
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,240
from the stake of comfort but the fire

230
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,640
of challenge. When you rise you will

231
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,000
rise unto glory. God's hand is upon you

232
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,880
elevating you beyond the stars. Know

233
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,600
this truth. Rejection is proof of

234
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,800
election. a celestial paradox

235
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,200
illuminating your path. Just as the sun

236
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,240
must set for the moon to rise, you must

237
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,040
endure darkness to embrace your light.

238
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,200
These trials serve a divine purpose,

239
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,160
restructuring your narrative in the

240
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,440
grand story of the universe. You are not

241
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,240
cast aside, but selected for greatness.

242
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,519
Like a jewel hidden in the earth, you

243
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,880
are meant to shine. God's favor rests

244
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,160
upon you, guiding every step you take.

245
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,519
Your exile is not a curse. It is a

246
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,880
blessing veiled in trials. The heavens

247
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,680
watch, awaiting your awakening. Your

248
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,200
spirit is forever ignited by divine

249
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:17,120
fire. Amidst the struggle, remember you

250
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,360
are blessed, destined, and chosen. This

251
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,480
law etched in your heart calls you to

252
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,519
ascend. Seek what this divine code

253
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,839
reveals about your life. Darkness is

254
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,399
essential to illuminate the brilliance

255
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,200
of your spirit in the world. You are

256
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,160
meant to walk with grace in light and in

257
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,680
shadow, navigating both realms with

258
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,320
wisdom. God's love compels you forward,

259
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,480
igniting passion for a purpose beyond

260
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,959
your understanding. You are walking

261
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,160
through the valley of shadows to emerge

262
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,399
as a beacon. comment. I walk crowned by

263
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,440
eternal flame. If this word speaks to

264
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,760
you, let the universe reverberate with

265
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,040
your echoes of affirmation. For your

266
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,399
voice carries power, you are enveloped

267
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,839
in a divine embrace, forever guided by

268
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,240
love. Trust in the journey before you,

269
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,440
knowing that every step is laden with

270
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,880
meaning. What lies ahead is richer than

271
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,360
what you now perceive. Every betrayal,

272
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,399
every silence, every scar is

273
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,040
confirmation of your divine calling.

274
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,920
Your personal trials mirror the cosmic

275
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,320
design crafted by the father's hand.

276
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,360
Each experience you faced was not

277
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,079
random. They were orchestrated for your

278
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,440
growth. The pain only confirms your

279
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,399
strength and resilience as a chosen one.

280
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,639
As you reflect on your journey, see how

281
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,600
intertwined it is with the eternal

282
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:51,200
truths. They propel you toward a purpose

283
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,000
rooted in love and light. These scars

284
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,199
are badges worn by warriors, each one

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,760
telling a sacred tale. God whispers to

286
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,040
you in these moments, beckoning you to

287
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,440
rise and embrace your truth. This shared

288
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,320
narrative of isolation links you to

289
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,839
countless souls forming an unbreakable

290
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,320
bond. You are dance of the universe, a

291
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,040
pivotal note in the grand melody of

292
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,839
existence. If this is the law that

293
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,880
shaped you, then what comes next is the

294
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,920
revelation awaiting you. Prepare your

hearts for the sky is clearing and the

296
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,360
dawn is breaking. The essence of what

has shaped your spirit will unveil the

298
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,360
profound truth of your path. There lies

299
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,600
within you a promise as yet unseen,

300
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,120
ready to bloom with the fullness of

301
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,079
time. As uncertainty looms, know that

302
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,360

303
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,519
awaiting your touch. Divine moments

God's grace. Let your heart resonate

331
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,880
with gratitude leading us further into

332
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,839
revelation. In the shadows where once

333
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,639
you felt abandoned, a revelation stirs

334
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,959
within your soul. You remember the dark

335
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,839
nights and the aching silence that

336
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,160
echoed your pain. The rejection wrapped

337
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,120
itself around your spirit like a heavy

338
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,600
cloak. Each moment of wailing seemed

339
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,720
pointless, filled with despair that

340
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,800
marked your longing. You wondered if God

341
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,480
had simply turned his face away from

342
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,440
you. But now at this sacred moment,

343
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,399
clarity glimmers through the darkness.

344
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,600
Those trials were not random. They were

345
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,800
the foundation of your awakening. Every

346
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,759
tear, every sigh, every feeling of

347
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,399
isolation was a step toward deeper

348
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,040
understanding. The fire of your sorrow

349
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,759
forged a heart capable of enduring

350
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,319
greatness. Even as Job stood firm

351
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,760
through loss, you are being called to

352
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,720
see this truth. Embrace it, for it holds

353
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,199
the key to your liberation. Your path

354
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,919
was coded in the heavens long before you

355
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,640
took your first breath. Each trial you

356
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,679
endured was an essential piece of your

357
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,480
divine preparation. The Lord does not

358
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,520
waste suffering. It becomes a sacred

359
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,200
tool shaping your spirit. Now you see

360
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,080
how the pain once seen as an enemy was

361
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,960
actually your greatest teacher. It

362
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,000
sculpted resilience within you, carving

363
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,559
out strength you never knew existed. You

364
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,360
were not merely surviving. You were

365
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,400
transforming, emerging as something

366
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,120
luminous. As the light of truth dawns

367
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,000
upon you, understand that silence was

368
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,960
not punishment, but protection. Through

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,919
periods of stillness, he revealed your

370
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,200
hidden purpose, guiding you on a course

371
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,240
fueled by grace. Like a pearl formed in

372
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,240
an oyster, every pang has led to a

373
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,880
profound metamorphosis.

374
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,760
Your essence is now rich with the oil of

375
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,520
wisdom bestowed upon those who seek and

376
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,840
believe. Silence, dear ones, was the

377
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,480
canvas on which God painted your

378
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,520
destiny. In moments when you felt

379
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,440
forsaken, the Lord was preparing you for

380
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,840
greater revelations.

381
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,720
Rejection was not meant to break you,

382
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,600
but to set apart your spirit. You needed

383
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,919
these experiences to unveil your true

384
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,280
essence, to give voice to the silent

385
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,840
roar within. The depths of despair were

386
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,880
sanctuaries nurturing the roots of your

387
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,520
strength. Just as Moses wandered the

388
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,320
desert, you too are finding your way

389
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,799
toward the promised land. The trials you

390
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,440
faced became the training grounds for

391
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,320
your vision. Allow yourself to soar

392
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,039
above the ashes of hurt, recognizing the

393
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,559
beauty that arises from the fires of

394
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,600
transformation.

395
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:12,559
Your scars are testaments of survival.

396
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,520
Each one a badge of honor. In this

397
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,600
awakening, trust that the Lord's hand is

398
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,960
guiding you toward a light-filled

399
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,840
horizon. Each betrayal you faced shifts

400
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,559
into a signpost marking your journey.

401
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,960
You now know these delays were necessary

402
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,000
rehearsals for the divine purpose

403
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,960
waiting ahead. Every wound you carry is

404
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,840
an initiation mark, a sacred reminder of

405
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,480
the battles you've bravely fought. The

406
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,880
darkness around you breeds wisdom,

407
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,520
inviting you to look beyond what is

408
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,840
presently visible. The tapestry of your

409
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,320
life is woven with threads of both

410
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,440
struggle and triumph, creating a

411
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,919
masterpiece of existence. Imagine

412
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,640
yourself as David standing before

413
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,240
Goliath, knowing you are destined to

414
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,799
overcome. In this moment, the fire has

415
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,080
burned away the illusions, revealing the

416
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,720
truth that has always been yours. God is

417
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,360
crafting a crown of glory to adorn your

418
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,640
head, refined by the trials of your

419
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,960
spirit. Fear not the scars you wear, for

420
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,160
they are an evidence of growth and

421
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,640
profound transformation. Embrace them as

422
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,919
sacred gifts leading you toward an

423
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,640
unimaginable future. Finally, you

424
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,679
understand that destiny was inscribed on

425
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,000
your heart long before you arrived. The

426
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,520
whispers of the universe reveal your

427
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,240
purpose, unearly yet familiar. Each

428
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,400
obstacle faced was a stepping stone

429
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,280
toward the awakening of your sacred

430
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,679
legacy. Like light breaking through the

431
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,559
darkness. Purpose floods your

432
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,000
consciousness. This is the moment you

433
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:59,760
were born to embrace. The awakening is

434
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,039
indeed upon you. In this divine

435
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,440
revelation, envision the glory waiting

436
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,440
on the other side of your struggles.

437
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,240
Your journey has sculpted you into a

438
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,039
beacon for other souls seeking the same

439
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,600
light. Comment. I rise marked by the

440
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,720
divine. If this word speaks to you,

441
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,120
share the ember of your spirit. Let your

442
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,919
testimony ignite the flame of hope in

443
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,600
others, becoming a living testament of

444
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,840
the divine. Together, we will rise and

445
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,200
embrace the calling that has always been

446
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,480
ours. The promise of what lies ahead is

447
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,760
rich with anticipation and light. This

448
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,159
revelation is not the culmination. It

449
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,280
marks the sacred doorway to greater

450
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,440
understanding. The struggles you endured

451
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,720
were the beginning of a much larger

452
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,360
narrative unfolding. You stand now at

453
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,000
the threshold with the spirit of God

454
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,720
guiding your next steps. What comes next

455
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,600
in your journey will reveal truths you

456
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,320
have not yet imagined. Embrace this

457
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,679
moment for the universe is aligning to

458
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,080
usher you forward. Take a deep breath.

459
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,720
Feel the divine current surging within

460
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,520
you. The awakening is only the

461
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,640
beginning. Liberation awaits

462
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,720
tantalizingly close. Are you ready to

463
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,679
embark on the next phase of your

464
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,880
transformation? A divine dance of faith

465
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:31,120
and action is calling you forth. This is

466
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:34,640
the hour of your unveiling. Awaken, dear

467
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,799
soul, to the calling of your spirit. The

468
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,000
shadows of doubt that once surrounded

469
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,400
you are now dissolving into light. Your

470
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,600
journey through silence has prepared you

471
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,360
to rise. God has placed within you a

472
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,200
radiant truth, one only you can share.

473
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,679
You are no longer defined by your

474
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,240
wounds, but by the healing that flows

475
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,880
through you. What was once the echo of

476
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,679
rejection now sings the harmony of

477
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,240
acceptance. The sacred recognition of

478
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,039
your presence here is the key to your

479
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,640
destiny. Embrace this moment of

480
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,360
proclamation for it is your time. You

481
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,240
stand at the threshold, prepared to step

482
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,880
into the fullness that awaits. You have

483
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,400
crossed the threshold, emerging from the

484
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,559
cocoon of isolation. Like the phoenix

485
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,039
arising from the ashes, your

486
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,600
transformation is profound and

487
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:33,360
beautiful. You have shed the past and

488
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,400
its shackles, becoming a beacon of hope.

489
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,360
You are the healed sign, a testament to

490
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,760
resilience and divinity. The fire that

491
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,280
once consumed you now serves as your

492
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,400
crown, an emblem of your journey. Each

493
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,760
scar tells a story of victory and grace,

494
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,240
marking you distinct. God's hand has

495
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,360
guided you through each trial, revealing

496
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,159
the strength he designed within. In the

497
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,919
quiet, you have found your voice, and

498
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,720
with it, your truth. This moment holds

499
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:10,000
the power of ancient promises that you

500
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,640
are worthy and loved. You are now who

501
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,760
you were always meant to be. You wear a

502
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,559
cloak of divine protection, imbued with

503
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,600
strength and purpose. It wraps around

504
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,480
you like an armor forged in the fires of

505
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,279
trials overcome. This mark upon your

506
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,760
spirit signals a hidden vow made before

507
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,720
you breathe your first. As fire

508
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,600
transforms into gold, so too have you

509
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,240
been initiated into the sacred ranks.

510
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,440
The elements of your past are now tools

511
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,400
of inspiration and guidance. You carry

512
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,440
the holy oil of anointing, blessed and

513
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,159
set apart for greatness. Your identity

514
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,360
is intertwined with a lineage of those

515
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,799
who came before you. Speak their names

516
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,360
for they stand beside you in spirit. God

517
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,240
smiles upon you as you embrace all that

518
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,799
you are destined to become. This sacred

519
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,080
journey is not merely about you, but

520
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:11,279
about the generations that will follow.

521
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Before births, you were chosen, a light

522
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,480
destined to shine in darkness. The

523
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,440
echoes of your ancestors resonate

524
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,480
through you, singing of hope and divine

525
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,200
purpose. Each of them whispered secrets

526
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,400
into the winds, preparing you for your

527
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,760
arrival. Your identity is carved in the

528
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,880
stars and sealed by his will. You are

529
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,840
marked, a warrior crafted with intention

530
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,840
to shake the foundations of the earth.

531
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,159
In stillness, remember [snorts] the

532
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,039
promises written in the scrolls of

533
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,840
heaven. God has commissioned you as a

534
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,960
guardian and a breaker of chains, a

535
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,120
revelatory force. The spirit celebrates

536
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,799
your awakening and all that you will

537
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,720
achieve. You are not alone. Your divine

538
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:03,440
lineage empowers you daily. Rise now,

539
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,640
bold in your identity as part of a

540
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,679
sacred legacy. In your veins flows

541
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,120
prophetic DNA, igniting dreams thought

542
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:15,679
lost in time. Every breath taken is a

543
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,720
declaration of sacred purpose written

544
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:21,520
across the ages. You bear the weight of

545
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,000
countless prayers, unbroken chains

546
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,960
connecting you to the divine. Your

547
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,640
lineage holds stories of courage like

548
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:34,000
David facing Goliath, emboldening you to

549
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,400
act. The scrolls speak of your destiny,

550
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,440
beckoning you ever closer to your

551
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,840
calling. When the time comes, you shall

552
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,120
fulfill the contracts made within the

553
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,440
