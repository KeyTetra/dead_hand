1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,880
Gemini, in the next few days, you're

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,120
going to be hit with a wave of abundance

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,760
that's going to make you very acutely

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,320
aware of how good you are at creating

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,920
abundance. Um, this is going to be a

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,359
physical um material or a practical gain

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,119
that's going to be highlighted. It's

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,400
going to be money. It's going to be

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,720
resources. It's going to be

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,240
opportunities. Okay? You're entering a

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,760
season where your independence and your

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
prosperity

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,960
are clearly rising. The nine of

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,640
pentacles is a card of the visible signs

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
of progress. It's going to be something

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
that you can measure. It's going to be

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,800
something that you can point to and say

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,920
objectively like it's working, you know.

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,960
So, enjoy the gain. Enjoy that abundance

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,760
as it's flowing in and let it change how

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,600
you see yourself. Okay. Now, Gemini,

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,000
this is a general reading for the one

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,320
one portal. Try to be open and receptive

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,199
to whatever may come through during our

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,800
time together. I am merely the messenger

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,640
and I ask you to connect directly with

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,360
each of these cards and use your own

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,840
intuition to take you beyond the details

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,360
that I provide. Wow, look at that. Look

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
at all this water energy. Wheel of

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,200
Fortune, a little five of swords, sure,

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,439
three of wands, 10 of pentacles. Holy

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,920
smokes, and the high priestess. There's

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,520
your intuition right there. I think

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,960
really spirit's saying continue to

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,640
follow your intuition because it's

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,360
obviously leading you in the right

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,960
direction. All right. Now, let's select

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
our mystery card, bonus card,

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,759
confirmation card. This is a random card

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,600
from the Smith Weight Tarot. This is the

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,159
factor infinite and unknown. We're going

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,520
to set it right here with Mr. Dao, the

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,040
yin-yang duck right there on top.

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,960
We're not going to look at that card

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,720
until the very end. It will tie

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,040
everything together and it will give us

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,520
the confirmation that we need at the end

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,200
of the reading. If at any moment during

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,200
this message you feel like you might

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,840
know what that card is, put your

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,840
prediction in the comments right below

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,759
the video. Now, what we're going to do

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,920
is select our spirit animal card. And

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,840
for you,

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,360
we have the giraffe spirit and it says

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,239
see the big picture. Okay, let me know

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,959
in the comments your experiences with

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,080
giraffes, if you've ever seen one in

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,440
person. Um, and what your what your

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,959
intuition tells you about this giraffe.

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,720
Okay. Um, about the long the long neck,

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,720
right? Being able to see above

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,680
everything else and and see the bigger

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,560
picture. Yeah. Um, and also I kind of

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,800
feel like there's some joke about um

67
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
about the time it takes for a giraffe to

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,480
swallow something. I don't I don't know

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,519
what that joke is, but what popped into

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,200
my head is that you're not so quick to

71
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,400
accept everything that that um that you

72
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,040
hear. You know, you don't swallow

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
anything too quickly. Like you you're

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,640
going to be rather cautious. And I think

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,000
that's really the high priestess, your

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,120
intuition, um guiding you and telling

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,560
you not everything is what it seems. Not

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,959
everything is um can be taken at face

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,080
value, right? So you have this ability

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,080
to look kind of between the lines and to

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,720
like to look in the shadows of things

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,080
and look behind the appearances and

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,080
really feel the subtle feelings. Um

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
especially when it comes to other people

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
and what they tell you and that sort of

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,440
thing. Seeing the big picture, but then

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,680
also being able to um to not be

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,799
gullible, right? to not swallow

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,599
everything too quickly. Um, and to to

90
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,599
use your own kind of higher discernment.

91
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,879
I think this is really really awesome.

92
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,640
Now, as we look around the room now,

93
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,360
again, let me know in the comments what

94
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,440
you're feeling about this giraffe.

95
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,440
We have some good majors here, right?

96
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,080
The High Priestess and the Wheel of

97
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,879
Fortune. Got some fire. We certainly

98
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,840
have water, water, water. Um, little bit

99
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,560
of air makes sense. And we have our our

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,720
earth cards here and here and here which

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
are also really extraordinary. Not

102
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,400
really a challenging card in the bunch,

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,439
right? Except for the five of swords,

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,280
but obviously this is not that bad. Um

105
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,799
there are way worse cards to get. I

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
think that the five of swords here is

107
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,400
saying that like you're skeptical that

108
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,880
you you'll see a nine of pentacles and

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,600
you'll see like you'll see the the line

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,280
going up and to the right, right? You'll

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,560
see the visible signs of progress, but

112
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,560
you're still thinking, I'm not going to

113
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,800
get carried away.

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,400
You know, I'm not going to um I'm not

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
going to rush to the bank yet. I'm just

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,639
going to keep my eye on it. I'm not

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,840
going to overreact. You know, you're not

118
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,560
like a you're not doubting everything.

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,000
You're not suspicious of everything,

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,440
but you you know, you're cautious and

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
you're a little bit skeptical. And I

122
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,199
think that is absolutely perfect right

123
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,280
here. This is the right amount of swords

124
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
cards to have in a reading. In any

125
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,560
reading, we got your intuition and you

126
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
got your logical mind that's saying,

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,759
"Okay, you know what? We're going to

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,320
work together and we're going to figure

129
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,240
out exactly how to keep this thing going

130
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,639
and make sure that what we are

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,720
experiencing is real and and all this

132
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
kind of stuff." I think also the five of

133
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,880
swords is saying that you've you've

134
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,560
sometimes doubted your own abilities,

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,880
right? Because the nine of pentacles to

136
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,840
me is telling you that

137
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,639
you can create abundance, that you can

138
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,280
create stability in your life. And like

139
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,440
I said at the beginning, enjoy the enjoy

140
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,320
the gain, enjoy the harvest, enjoy the

141
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,639
abundance, but also let it change how

142
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,880
you see yourself.

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,240
Okay? And now that we have the five of

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,039
swords, that statement makes a little

145
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,800
bit more sense to me. Um, you know,

146
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,720
since it just kind of popped into my

147
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,880
head. Now it makes sense because it's

148
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,520
like you you didn't always see yourself

149
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,160
as someone that that could create

150
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,840
abundance, you know, or or that like you

151
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,039
always you always knew that you were

152
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,600
strong. You always knew that you were

153
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,840
capable, but I wonder if there was a

154
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,400
period of doubt about whether it would

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,280
actually work or you know whether it

156
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,759
would um whether it would it would bear

157
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,160
any fruit. Okay. But this is something

158
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,199
that is really truly strengthening your

159
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,880
independence. And I think it's probably

160
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,479
financial. It could be something to do

161
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,560
with property or an estate or or

162
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,080
something uh in terms of legacy or

163
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,960
generational wealth. But I feel like

164
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,120
there's a real real independence here.

165
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
Enjoy the comfort that you're that

166
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,880
you're going to be experiencing,

167
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,960
especially that nine. Ooh, the nine of

168
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,319
cups. The nine of cups is happiness. Um,

169
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,319
it's not just financial

170
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,639
increase, but it's an increase of the

171
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,000
quality of your life. Okay, the nine,

172
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,000
the nines are the increase cards.

173
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,520
Now, pardon me if I hit the cough button

174
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,520
a few times during the reading today.

175
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,360
Okay. All right. So, uh, the nine of,

176
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,479
uh, cups is the increase of the quality

177
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,720
of life. So, your life is going to be

178
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,880
visibly better. Like, okay, your bank

179
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,479
account's going up. Okay, sure. Your

180
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
there's more money in your in your

181
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,720
wallet. Okay, good.

182
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,440
But there's also more joy in your heart.

183
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,520
There's also uh more of a of an

184
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
abundance in your spirit. You know, like

185
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,520
the quality of your life is increasing.

186
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,680
Um you're you're uh you're eliminating

187
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,240
suffering for yourself and others,

188
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,759
right? And and so there's this physical

189
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,479
increase, but then also this kind of

190
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,319
spiritual or emotional increase or

191
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,080
fulfillment and this kind of

192
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,599
satisfaction or just like the um

193
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,400
the uh the bliss, you know. Um it's uh

194
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,720
to me it feels like a deeper

195
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,520
a deeper kind of love and a deeper kind

196
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,000
of uh appreciation

197
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,879
for yourself and for the people around

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,240
you. It's almost a contentment,

199
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,479
you know.

200
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,705
I think that what it is, it's it's kind

201
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,800
of like your wishes are coming true.

202
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:08,800
[snorts] Yeah. They're showing visible

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,560
signs of coming true. And I think this

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,680
overflows your heart with love. Yeah.

205
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,840
And um it's that joy of like of

206
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,400
realizing that okay, it's it's working

207
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,160
and I can I'm starting to feel like I

208
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,599
can believe in this now. And you know um

209
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,400
it's it's going to feel almost

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,560
overwhelmingly good. That's a pretty

211
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,959
good problem to have, isn't it? Um,

212
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,279
share this good mood with other people.

213
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,279
Okay. Share your good fortune with other

214
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,760
people. To me, these two cards together

215
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,320
is an empress life. It's the best life

216
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,080
that's that's taking shape.

217
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,320
So, Gemini, I think the one- one portal

218
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,800
is really going to be a significant

219
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,240
turning point for you where something

220
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,640
goes from being like, well, I don't know

221
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,880
if it's going to work to, oh my gosh,

222
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,360
it's working. And not only is it sort of

223
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,800
working, but oh my gosh, it's working,

224
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,880
working, working. Um, so there's no

225
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,600
guilt over this, right? There's no like

226
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,680
apprehension. It's like you're realizing

227
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,959
that you can feel abundant, that you can

228
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,959
create abundance and stability in your

229
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,000
life and also that you're allowed to

230
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,680
feel emotional stability and emotional

231
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,600
safety.

232
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,440
Happiness is like, you know, is kind of

233
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,320
teaching you that it's a you're you're

234
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,000
allowed to be joyful. You're allowed to

235
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:35,200
feel good and be happy about the life

236
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,920
that you're creating. Okay. Um happiness

237
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,200
is how the path should feel when it's

238
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,200
working. See the nine of pentacles, what

239
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,959
you're doing is working. You're running

240
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,640
a business. It's working. It's making

241
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,959
money. Okay? It should feel good, you

242
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,839
know. It should feel should feel

243
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,760
extraordinary.

244
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,880
And I think that this is that that kind

245
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,519
of satisfaction. Yeah. Down beneath the

246
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,200
surface with the Ace of Cups though, it

247
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,000
kind of feels like it's not always easy

248
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,240
for you to to let yourself feel feel

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
those those kinds of uh feelings, right?

250
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
And maybe because there's that little

251
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,360
five of swords there that's a little bit

252
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,959
of that doubt or a little bit of that um

253
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't know almost like a feeling that

254
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,320
no matter how much you're creating, no

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,200
matter how good you're objectively doing

256
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,120
in life, there's always this feeling of

257
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,440
I'm not doing enough or I'm not good

258
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,279
enough or even I don't deserve it. So

259
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,600
all that stuff's got to go right out the

260
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,480
window because you do deserve it because

261
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,320
you've created this. Your efforts, your

262
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
virtues, your sacrifices, your

263
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,880
sufferings have have created this

264
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,040
success.

265
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,440
And with the Ace of Cups, this is now

266
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,519
your heart is opening. You're allowing

267
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,720
this love to flow. Okay? This is really

268
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,399
like um you're not

269
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,279
you're not going to feel as if you have

270
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,399
to kind of like quiet down your joy. You

271
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,079
know, I don't want to I don't want

272
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,600
anyone to see me celebrating. you know,

273
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,680
you're going to celebrate out in the

274
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,519
open with all your friends and family,

275
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,800
you know,

276
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,480
but at the same time, you're going to

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,480
see the bigger picture. And I think the

278
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,240
bigger picture really is that like all

279
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,880
the success here is something for you to

280
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,200
share. It's really so my gosh, it's so

281
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,920
awesome to have the nine of cups, 10 of

282
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,560
cups, nine of pentacles, 10 of pentacles

283
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,279
because this is like the the bigger

284
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,279
picture here is that uh the nines are

285
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,600
the verbs. This is like the happiness,

286
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,200
the success that keeps on happening, you

287
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,000
know. This is the gain that just keeps

288
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,440
on gaining, the the the profit that

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,079
keeps on building up, you know, but the

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,760
tens are the bigger picture. The tens

291
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,160
are like, what are you creating with all

292
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,880
of this success and happiness? You're

293
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,880
creating a a happy life. You're creating

294
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,120
a legacy. You're creating generational

295
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,200
wealth. You're creating, you know, a a

296
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,959
stable environment for your family and

297
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,880
friends and loved ones and, you know,

298
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,160
your pets, your plants, your people.

299
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,839
You're creating your best life. And I

300
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,519
think that this is the ideal that you

301
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,160
have for your best life. And this is you

302
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,160
creating it, doing the verb stuff, the

303
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,000
actual actions

304
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,160
that are creating this this ideal form.

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,920
Okay?

306
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,880
I think it's not always easy for you to

307
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,079
to receive joy or to receive pleasure or

308
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,079
to to receive even like recognition. So

309
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,440
to me, it feels like this Ace of Cups is

310
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,639
a it's kind of you with your heart open

311
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,680
being very very ready to receive. It's

312
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,880
your time, right? It's your you're due.

313
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,279
You're overdue for some reception, for

314
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,920
some uh harvest, and for some abundance

315
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,959
coming in. Okay? And I think it's

316
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,040
because you're always the one that's

317
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,720
giving out. You're always the one that's

318
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,440
that's providing and putting in the work

319
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,440
and putting in the hours and and making

320
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,600
sacrifices on I'm not going to have the

321
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,560
ice cream today cuz I'm I'm working on

322
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,279
my goals. You know, I think that this is

323
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,920
now like you're realizing that you're

324
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,240
you've got your your cup and uh you're

325
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,920
ready to receive all the blessings. All

326
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,279
the blessings. Yeah. Um the four of

327
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,720
pentacles back here I think is really

328
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,480
nice too cuz this to me feels like

329
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,200
stability.

330
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,880
You know to for one thing it feels like

331
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:27,120
um you invested a lot in something

332
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,279
and that investment um was a risk. You

333
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,680
had to roll the dice in a way. You had

334
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,079
to take what you had and put it into

335
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,639
something else and hope that it gives

336
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,800
you back more than what you put in or

337
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,079
hope you don't like lose everything, you

338
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,639
know. So whether this was you saying I

339
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,959
believe in my dream, I'm going allin. Or

340
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,959
if this is you saying like, I I believe

341
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,440
in this in this business and I'm going

342
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,839
to I'm going to commit myself to it or

343
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,680
or going to school or I don't know what

344
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,440
it was, right? It could be all sorts of

345
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,680
things. Um this is your willingness to

346
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,000
to put in

347
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,240
um the resources that you had. Okay,

348
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,639
your power. The four of pentacles is

349
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,360
called power. Your power is how you

350
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,360
manage your resources.

351
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,480
Doesn't matter how much or how little

352
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,720
you have. It's how you manage those

353
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,760
resources that really determine where

354
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,240
you're going to go, what you're going to

355
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,360
do in life. You know, time, effort,

356
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,639
energy, money, space, and spirit.

357
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:35,279
How you manage those resources. And I

358
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:37,680
think that you you invested them. you

359
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,000
invested yourself into something that

360
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,600
can grow into something bigger. It's

361
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,399
also telling me that you probably come

362
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,920
from very humble backgrounds.

363
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,320
Um that maybe when you grew up you

364
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,000
didn't have a lot. The cupboards weren't

365
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,440
bare, but they weren't overflowing

366
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
either. And uh and so I think that it's

367
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,000
you're kind of in almost a a constant

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,160
like not a not a poverty mindset, but

369
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,220
it's just like you know how to live

370
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,959
below your means. And so even when even

371
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,079
[clears throat] when you get super rich

372
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,440
in life, um you're still going to for

373
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,639
the most part operate in the the old

374
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,320
way, you know, the more frugal way and

375
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,760
the really the more responsible way. you

376
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,079
know, like your lifestyle isn't going to

377
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,040
creep up um as your as your success

378
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,920
rises in life because you know what it's

379
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,680
like to be um you know what it's like to

380
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,160
be maybe paycheck to paycheck.

381
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,320
Okay. And I think that's given you this

382
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,279
bigger picture thing too because when

383
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,360
you have this I think I feel like it's a

384
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,880
windfall. I feel like it's suddenly I

385
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,839
don't know suddenly something starts

386
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,480
flowing in for you. Yeah. It would be

387
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,480
very easy to just feel like I just got

388
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,079
to spend it now. My job is to just spend

389
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,240
all this wonderful money that's coming

390
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,920
in. But that's not you. You got the

391
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,800
bigger picture. You're saying no, I'm

392
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,399
going to be responsible. You're the sort

393
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,440
of um you're the the caretaker of this

394
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,759
in a way. Yeah. It's your responsibility

395
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,519
to sort of maintain this and to make

396
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,600
sure that there is something left or to

397
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,600
make sure that it keeps growing for, you

398
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,079
know, the future and make sure it lasts

399
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,240
you, you know, into the into your

400
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,399
retirement or into the next generations

401
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,440
of your family or something. And so, um,

402
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,440
it's not just your job to to spend all

403
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,240
of this energy that's coming in, but for

404
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,079
you to preserve it. Yeah. And I and I

405
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,759
think that you grew up in a way that

406
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:42,399
that kind of taught you the the nec

407
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:47,440
necessity of that or taught you the

408
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:50,880
skills needed to do that. Yeah.

409
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,880
Anyway, um the 10 of cups here at the

410
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,519
top, this is all that this is that that

411
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,880
family energy. This is just like it

412
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:03,040
really is the the overflowing uh life of

413
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:06,480
just abundance. And I think um

414
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,559
in a way like the the complete absence

415
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,400
of suffering

416
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,679
and that's not going to ever be real,

417
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,600
right? I mean a 10 is kind of like

418
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,240
it's an open-ended card there. There

419
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,280
really is no achieving perfection, but

420
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,000
it really is like peak emotions.

421
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,360
Okay, peak peak emotions. And I think

422
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,120
that um you know you you can let your

423
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,080
cup overflow, but you got to stay

424
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,400
conscious. You can enjoy and indulge in

425
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,760
what your uh the energy that's coming

426
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,919
in, but you're going to keep the bigger

427
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,840
picture in mind.

428
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,520
Okay?

429
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,600
And most of all, I think that this is

430
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,440
you sharing

431
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,720
and appreciating your people, your

432
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,200
family, friends, partners, your pets. Um

433
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,120
watch out for overindulgence,

434
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,799
okay? Don't drown yourself in what you

435
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,799
enjoy.

436
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,520
Yeah, this is something for you to

437
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,559
savor, but also keep the bigger picture

438
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,840
in mind. It's not your job to just spend

439
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,960
everything that's coming in now. Okay?

440
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,880
It's your job to keep this going. It's

441
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,520
your job to continue building. It's your

442
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,840
job to to think of the um think of how

443
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,960
much good you can do with with what's

444
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,039
coming in. Yeah. So, it's not about how

445
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,720
much money you're you're making. It's

446
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,720
about like what you're doing with that

447
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,039
money. And you're doing something for

448
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,200
the future. You're doing something that

449
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:36,480
is going to um it's going to benefit

450
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:39,039
people beyond just you. Yeah. And I

451
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,640
think that's um

452
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,600
I think that really shows where your

453
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,919
heart is and where your priorities are.

454
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,679
Now, Wheel of Fortune, moving forward,

455
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,280
spirit is going to continue to put the

456
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,520
right people, places, and things on your

457
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,520
path. Spirit will line you up. Spirit

458
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,280
will set up the pins. You got to knock

459
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,799
them down. Okay? You got to keep

460
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,799
knocking the pins down, and you'll

461
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,080
continue to keep this wheel of fortune

462
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,960
moving in your favor. Okay? Um once the

463
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,880
wheel of fortune starts turning, it can

464
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,360
stop. The thing is, through our actions

465
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,520
and our interactions with the universe,

466
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,200
we can keep this wheel going.

467
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,799
And this is the wheel of profit, the

468
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,520
wheel of prosperity, the wheel of

469
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,400
business, right? The wheel of fortune.

470
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,919
Um, and so spirit will set up the pins

471
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,840
and you got to knock them down. And so

472
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,840
in other words, don't stop doing what

473
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
you've been doing.

474
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,799
Okay?

475
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:39,919
um the practices, the habits, the

476
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:44,400
techniques, the behaviors, the decisions

477
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,000
um that have got you here. Those are the

478
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,760
ones that are going to take you even

479
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
further. So those are the ones that you

480
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,160
got to lock in. Don't stop doing what

481
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,559
you've been doing. Maybe the four of

482
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,080
pentacles too is that idea of like you

483
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,640
have very solid habits.

484
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,480
you have a very good rhythm to your

485
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,600
life. Now, just because you're getting

486
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,840
all this money and all this happiness,

487
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,000
don't let it throw you off your your

488
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,240
habits or your rhythm or your routine.

489
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,039
Now, of course, you can celebrate and

490
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,320
you can, you know, um you can make some

491
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,640
indulgences here and there, but overall

492
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,520
see the big picture and stick to the

493
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,760
routine. Stick to the habit. Okay? Don't

494
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,080
let this this uh this big energy change

495
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,400
the way you do things because it is

496
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,440
exactly the way you've done things that

497
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,600
have has brought those nines here, you

498
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,960
know. And I think that's the message of

499
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,280
the wheel of fortune that we got to keep

500
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,880
that wheel turning. And we do that by

501
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,760
showing up and being

502
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,240
being in our best energy, having our

503
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,159
integrity and our virtue, continuing to

504
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,240
do hard things, continuing to have the

505
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,080
the sort of vision and the foresight and

506
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,000
the insight um to, you know, to know how

507
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,280
to engage because like I said, spirit's

508
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,520
going to put the right people, places,

509
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,960
and things on your path when and where

510
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,520
you need them. It's up to you to know

511
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,640
how to interact with those things. You

512
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,840
got to be at the right place at the

513
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,919
right time and you got to make the right

514
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,120
decisions. You know, spirit can only set

515
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,080
up the pins. You got to knock them down.

516
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,360
All right. Now, that five of swords, uh,

517
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,280
like I said, this could be a little bit

518
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,919
of doubt. This could be a little bit of

519
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,559
like kind of disbelieving that this is

520
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,960
real, you know, and I think it's

521
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,840
important that you acknowledge out loud

522
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,679
you are capable of this. You know what I

523
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,159
we should do is a well let's do an

524
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,159
oracle of manifestation

525
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,320
because see sometimes the five of swords

526
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,520
is a little bit of this fear that um you

527
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,120
know it's it's uh it's a mistake you

528
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,400
know we're getting all this abundance

529
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,200
all this energy but then there's just

530
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,600
like no it can't be for me cuz I'm I've

531
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,919
never had this before this can't be real

532
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,000
you know and when we have those kinds of

533
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,480
negative thoughts then we end up making

534
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,039
poor decisions and then of course these

535
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,960
things can leave. So, here's an oracle

536
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,360
of manifestation for you. We have inner

537
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,280
peace. Cultivate inner calm through

538
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,440
meditation or mindful practices. I let

539
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,760
go and have faith. Exactly. Right.

540
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,280
Because what do I say about the five?

541
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,240
Anytime we get a five, we start looking

542
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,120
around for the four. What's the four of

543
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,840
swords?

544
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,080
Meditation, breath work, mindfulness

545
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,159
practices that will cultivate an inner

546
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,559
calm. This is a card of kind of like

547
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:37,120
stress or doubt or like um you know some

548
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,520
self-defeating thoughts kind of thing,

549
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,440
right? Our our inner tone is not all

550
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:47,360
that kind sometimes. Yeah. Um [snorts]

551
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,559
and uh I think that what this is is is

552
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,960
literally saying like just calm calm

553
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,320
your mind down. choose to let go and

554
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,919
choose to have faith and choose to

555
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,360
believe

556
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,200
that you've done this, that you've

557
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,039
created this and you are capable of

558
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,640
this. Well, that's what the high

559
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,960
priestess is asking you to to have

560
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,120
faith, hope, and trust. She's saying,

561
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,320
"Take my hand and follow me and we will

562
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,320
go to Big Rock Candy Mountain."

563
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,640
Okay, but you're saying, "I don't know

564
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,880
if this is really for me or you know,

565
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,000
there's this kind of internal turmoil

566
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,559
here. What we need to do is the the the

567
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,301
inner calm. Cultivate that, right? The

568
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,080
inner calm is the intercom with spirit.

569
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:30,080
[snorts] Yeah. So, meditation,

570
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,600
mindfulness practices, let go and have

571
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,159
faith. Put that in the comments. Say, I

572
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,559
let go and have faith because that's

573
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,720
what's going to continue to push this

574
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,799
forward for you. Okay. Um trusting in

575
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,400
your intuition, taking the hand of

576
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,679
spirit, and letting that high priestess

577
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,960
guide you. Okay. The three of wands here

578
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,240
is um is a card of virtue and it's in

579
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,159
the position of your environment and

580
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,799
your relationships. I feel like there

581
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,559
may be a very challenging decision

582
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,120
you're going to have to make very soon

583
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,720
about a a person in your life. Um, and

584
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,559
it may be that it's going to have to be

585
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,720
like a goodbye or even like

586
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,080
even like maybe like a reprimand like I

587
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,760
don't know if if you work with somebody

588
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,480
that you're that you have a personal

589
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,159
relationship with um or that you kind of

590
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,000
got to be a little bit blunt with

591
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,679
somebody,

592
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,880
okay? Maybe it's a friend, maybe it's a

593
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,640
family member where um you can't just

594
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,720
kind of let things keep going the way

595
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,840
they've been going. that you need to

596
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,720
kind of uh step up and and say things

597
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,440
directly, not in a cruel way, but I

598
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,880
think um I don't I don't necessarily

599
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,640
think it's a goodbye, but I do think

600
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,400
it's it's kind of um uh it has to be

601
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,240
very direct.

602
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,320
Okay? And it's going to change the

603
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,480
nature of the relationship a little bit.

604
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,559
But I think that it's it's important

605
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,400
that you you start early with

606
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,960
maintaining the boundaries and the

607
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,559
expectations for yourself and for other

608
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,400
people because especially when you start

609
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,320
getting all this success coming in and

610
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,679
this big wave of abundance that's coming

611
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,159
in, there going to be a lot of people

612
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,679
coming out of the woodwork, okay, that

613
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,799
are going to think they know you or

614
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,520
they're going to think that you owe

615
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,080
them. So, I feel like this is really

616
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,080
about you protecting your boundaries and

617
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,520
enforcing your boundaries, but also

618
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,600
being willing to um being willing to do

619
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,080
the difficult things because you believe

620
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,720
that they are the right things. Yeah.

621
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,039
And you know, doing the right thing is

622
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,240
not always the most difficult thing.

623
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,240
um the you know the

624
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,159
um

625
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,919
the high road is not always the most

626
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,400
difficult road but I think sometimes um

627
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,960
you know sometimes it's going to seem

628
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,640
like you are being kind of harsh but

629
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,039
that's

630
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,960
kind of in the eye of the beholder right

631
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,799
um when you have to enforce a boundary

632
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,480
with somebody

633
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,240
that person's probably going to get

634
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,960
pissed

635
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,080
Okay, if that's somebody with whom you

636
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,360
need to enforce a boundary, then that's

637
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,159
probably somebody that's going to get

638
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,480
mad about it. Okay, that does that's no

639
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,960
reflection on you. I think as long as

640
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,200
you can honestly say that you are kind

641
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,720
and respectful, but also firm. Um,

642
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,559
do what you need to do because you're

643
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,159
you're protecting something here. It's

644
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:26,000
not just about you protecting yourself.

645
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:28,159
you're protecting um a a business, a

646
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,279
company, a legacy, an an estate or

647
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,919
something. You know what I mean? It's a

648
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,520
bigger it's a bigger picture that you're

649
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,400
that you're protecting. It's not just

650
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,440
you and your personal interests. Uh the

651
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:43,120
10 of Pentacles here is that legacy. It

652
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,279
is um generational wealth. It's the

653
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,279
long-term plans and the long-term goals.

654
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,360
What is the bigger picture here for you?

655
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,400
Um, I think that's something that you

656
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,679
probably already know like what that is.

657
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,523
But the card is in this position of kind

658
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,760
of the the jail, the prison. Um,

659
00:26:58,523 --> 00:27:01,679
[snorts] it's the card that's kind of

660
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,120
locked up right now. And the reason is,

661
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,440
I think, because prior to to this energy

662
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,919
coming in, maybe you didn't quite

663
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,480
believe that the future that you aspired

664
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,919
to was actually possible.

665
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,799
Something's happening in the next few

666
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,679
days that's going to unlock this future.

667
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,600
And it's going to show you

668
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,919
visible signs of progress that this

669
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,480
future is real.

670
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,640
Okay? It's unlocking it from that that

671
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,400
prison of doubt.

672
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,120
Okay? You're going to fully believe and

673
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,679
I think you you have to already believe

674
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,039
that this future is real.

675
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,720
Okay? And the high priestess,

676
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,080
you know, the high priestess is that

677
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,799
faith, that hope, and that trust uh is

678
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,960
the guiding force. And so the the cards

679
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,880
really are saying that the way forward

680
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,039
for you, okay, the long-term trajectory,

681
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,520
your bigger arc here is all about you

682
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,520
trusting yourself. And maybe the five of

683
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,600
swords is is kind of saying that in the

684
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,240
past, you haven't always trusted your

685
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,919
decisions or you've doubted yourself.

686
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,840
You know, you've you've uh taken an

687
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,320
action and then you kind of, you know,

688
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,760
you secondguess it later on and stuff. I

689
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,000
think the high priestess is saying you

690
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,399
need to learn to trust yourself cuz you

691
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,399
know what you're doing and you know how

692
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,120
to navigate this life and you know how

693
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,960
to make good decisions. So make the good

694
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,480
decisions and don't second guessess

695
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,399
yourself. Listen inward, okay? Is your

696
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,840
soul is whispering to you and I think

697
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,760
that your your intuition is um is

698
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:39,120
guiding you every second. Okay. Um, I

699
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,440
also feel that there is like there

700
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,159
this has to do with that that person.

701
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,840
Again, I think in a in a few days, very

702
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,840
soon, there's going to be a change in

703
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,240
the nature of a relationship in your

704
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,240
life. And I think that you probably

705
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,159
already know who I'm talking about

706
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,760
because this is like you've already

707
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,520
started to sense something about

708
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,720
someone.

709
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,480
And I think that you're going to have to

710
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,080
set a boundary or put your foot down

711
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,600
somewhere very soon. Okay. Uh this is

712
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,919
also a card that is saying you don't

713
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,000
have to share everything with everybody

714
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,880
that you need to again with that giraffe

715
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,720
and the really long neck. Um take your

716
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,679
time when you when you swallow

717
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,240
something, you know, don't don't just uh

718
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,240
um don't be too gullible that you're

719
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,919
just accepting and believing everything

720
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:29,039
everybody tells you. Uh so be a little

721
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,799
bit skeptical. Okay? Trust in your own

722
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,840
intuition. you got a bad vibe about

723
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:37,760
something, you know, give yourself some

724
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:41,279
some uh room, some meditation, right? Uh

725
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,279
for clarity before you just kind of um

726
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,399
swallow it, hookline and sinker as they

727
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,880
say, right? And so I think your

728
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,039
intuition is is guiding you both into

729
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,600
deeper prosperity, but helping you to

730
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,760
avoid the pitfalls and the calamities

731
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,240
along the way. Let's look at the mystery

732
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,240
card. Gemini.

733
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,799
Uh, this is probably going to be some

734
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,240
nasty swords cards. I feel uh if you

735
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,120
have a prediction, put it in the

736
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,080
comments. Let's see.

737
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,640
Oh, no. Okay. The judgment card. Yeah,

738
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,679
this is kind of the similar vibe that I

739
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,039
was thinking with the I was thinking

740
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,720
with the swords cards. Yeah, there's

741
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,320
going to be some kind of a there's going

742
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,240
to be friction with this person. I don't

743
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,640
know who they are, but their vibe is

744
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,960
coming in pretty strong here.

745
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,279
I think that this is you trusting your

746
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,200
own judgment

747
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,399
about this person. And I think if it has

748
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,000
to be goodbye excommunication, then

749
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,360
that's what you're going to do. And

750
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,159
you're not going to let them convince

751
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,360
you or feed you a story.

752
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,679
You're not you're not just going to

753
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,000
swallow that story like it's truth, you

754
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,360
know. Um

755
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,679
they're not just going to feed you a

756
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,279
line. Yeah. Um, [snorts]

757
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,640
so you may have to kind of cut somebody

758
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,960
off or or or um block somebody from your

759
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,720
life, but I think that this is a

760
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,200
judgment that you're making about a

761
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,039
relationship and you have to trust in

762
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,080
your judgment because you are making the

763
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,840
right call. Okay. Uh the judgment card

764
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,919
is also a doorway card and I think that

765
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,919
this is the moment the one- one portal

766
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,679
for you is the moment where your life

767
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,039
shifts where you realize that you're now

768
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,360
on the other side. um you're on the

769
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:25,120
other side of this this doorway where

770
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:29,200
your future is is here, you know, uh

771
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:31,360
that this prosperity is now. Um and it's

772
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,559
to me it's a pivotal moment. It's the

773
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,120
moment where you go from this just being

774
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,760
like I hope it's true or I hope it's

775
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,919
going to work to like wow it's working.

776
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,760
It's more than working. You know, again,

777
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,919
with the visible sign of progress. This

778
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,120
is something that marks a a definite

779
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,480
turning point in your life. All right,

780
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,600
