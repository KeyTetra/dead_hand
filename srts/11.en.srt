00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,640
here with me. His name is Charlie. He's

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,079
new to the family. Hi, Birdie. And um he

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,520
I don't know what happened with him, but

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,600
I found him and he was skinny and um

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,040
just it wasn't looking good. He was, you

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,360
know, this wasn't looking good. So, I'm

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
taking care of him as much as I can. Um,

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,880
I want to take him to the vet, but I'm

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
having a hard time getting to the vet

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,640
already. Like, I don't have a car, but I

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
did find out that there's something

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,159
called like you can you use Uber for

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,479
your pets. So, that's the um that's

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,640
where I'm going is I'm trying to go in

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,440
that lane. I'm going to use Uber to go

58
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,280
take them to the vet as soon as I can.

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,879
Um because it's not just him that needs

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,080
to go to the vet. I have other cats that

61
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,879
need to see a doctor ASAP. Um and

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,560
Twitter, you know, her leg. Uh, anyways,

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,599
I don't want to go there right now. It's

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,959
just All right, let's um get into the

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,760
message, you guys. Thank you for being

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,519
here. I appreciate you guys a lot. It's

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,840
okay, mama. All right, so

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,840
this message,

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,239
you could be from Sirius cuz we have

70
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,160
both star I mean both cards coming out

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,400
that are from the star system named

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,599
Sirius. Okay, so what we have at the

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,319
bottom of the deck is good intentions.

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,879
And then what flipped out was saving

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,080
humanity. And you know what behind that

76
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,280
I have to say graduation. And this is

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,640
perfect because

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,080
so Sirius was um is a star system that

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,159
back in the day they had the best

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,640
intentions, you know, to save humanity,

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,120
to help humanity in some way. But what

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,760
happened is they got very obsessed with

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,360
it. Um

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,400
and now you know they're realizing that

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,680
um the way to save humanity is to become

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,080
that example. You can't save anybody but

87
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,840
you can become the example that people

88
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,000
can look up to or become that lighthouse

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
for people is what I'm saying. And I'm

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,040
this is the vibe I'm getting from you.

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,040
This is the message coming through for

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,040
you today. There's something here about

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,640
you having the best intentions in the

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,480
world to save humanity or I'm getting

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,040
here someone wanting to save a family

96
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,319
member. Okay, in specific or wanting to

97
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,280
save your family in general.

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,599
So um

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,360
right now you are graduating okay and

100
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,560
this is what's happening. You are

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,200
realizing that I cannot save anybody. I

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,439
can only become that example and this is

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,959
what you've done. I'm talking to someone

104
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,280
who you have put the world of sorry the

105
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,519
weight of the world on your shoulders

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,639
wanting to save everyone okay you have

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,960
the best intentions to do so but the

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,040
there was a problem here it was like God

109
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,840
had to show you like you can't save

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,360
anyone but you can become that example

111
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,120
that people can look to okay and that's

112
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
what you're doing I'm talking to someone

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,240
who's doing this okay um you're going

114
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,000
through an activation right

115
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,880
Wow. And behind that we have activated

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,960
earth too.

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,720
Mother Gia has been helping to activate

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,720
you. Okay. I'm talking to someone who

119
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,479
gets activated through mother Gia.

120
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,960
Whether you watch things online about

121
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,400
animals or you watch things about um the

122
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,160
earth or something um or whether you do

123
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,320
this out in the physical, you know. Um

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
either way, you get activated through

125
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,759
mother Gia. Okay. Whether I don't know

126
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,840
if you're listening to frequencies or

127
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,840
whatnot. I don't know. But you have been

128
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,840
activated.

129
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,800
Your light body has been activated.

130
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,360
Okay? And this is what you're doing. You

131
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,520
you have been devoted

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,000
to saving people, but now you're devoted

133
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,240
to saving yourself and becoming that

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,960
example, making your life a moving

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,199
prayer. That's what's happening here.

136
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,960
This is how you're saving humanity. um

137
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,720
is realizing that you're not able to

138
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,720
save humanity. Um but you can be that

139
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,639
example and by being that example you

140
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,280
are saving humanity. Do you see what I'm

141
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,680
saying? Um okay.

142
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,479
So make your life a moving prayer and we

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,280
have prayer coming out here. Um but what

144
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,280
I want to talk about first is this.

145
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay. You are in perfect harmony right

146
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,479
now for something to come in or to move

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,560
forward in some way. there is something

148
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,039

149
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,960
for. Um,

150
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,880

151
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,560
for people. You you want the best for

152
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,880

You have the best intentions. Mary

154
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
motive.

155
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,479
You have the best intentions with

156
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,120
everything you do. I'm talking to

157
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,120
someone. You have beautiful intentions.

158
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Um,

159
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,400
okay.

160
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,319

162
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,600
saving humanity. You're becoming a

163
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,080
moving prayer. You're making your life a

164
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,080
moving prayer.

165
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,680
And this is what is healing your

166
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,680
connections.

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,280
You guys, for someone in specific, I

168
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,360
just have to say really quick, okay?

169
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,120
This could be your family or a family

170
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,720
member that you have been wanting to

171
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,440
help

172
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,199
and it's been hard for you to move

173
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,440
forward because you see yourself

174
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,120
transforming and you you're just you

175
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,520
just want to help them as well. And I'm

176
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,639
talking to someone who has let go.

177
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,280
You've let go of the res here and you

178
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,240
just became the example and by doing

179
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,880
this you are saving your family.

180
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,960
Okay, that's for someone in specific.

181
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,240
For others of you, this is humanity in

182
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,280
general. Okay, we do have family tree

183
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,815
though. Okay, we have family tree coming

184
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,479
out. This is expansion. This is legacy.

185
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:42,319
[clears throat]

186
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,599
And then we have emotional desert coming

187
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,280
out here for you.

188
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,720
And I'm getting that you could have had

189
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,080
to pull back your emotions from your

190
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,479
family in specific or whoever you're

191
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,720
wanting to save here. It's like you had

192
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,560
to cut your emotions out of it and leave

193
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,199
your emotions out of it and just become

194
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,440
that and just become that example. And

195
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,759
by doing this, like I said, you're

196
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,440
moving forward here. The old has

197
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,440
crumbled. We have the tower. It's over.

198
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,240
You're moving forward now with the eight

199
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,199
of wands. Okay. And again with the this

200
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,960
making a wish. There you are. There's

201
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,160
something coming in here that you wished

202
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:28,120
for as a child that you're seeing come

203
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,120
to fruition now.

204
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,120
Wow. And again, look at this. It's

205
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,560
because you let something go.

206
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,959
someone here. It's like you've released

207
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,560
the outcome of a prayer or of wish um of

208
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,360
how something you it's like something

209
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,200
you wanted to see something come to

210
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,600
fruition and you've released the outcome

211
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,800
of this of how it's going to happen.

212
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,320
You're like, I don't know how it's going

213
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,720
to happen, but I don't I just know it's

214
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,480
going to happen. And you've released it.

215
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,240
This is why. Okay, so you've released

216
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:04,320
it. This is why prosperity is about to

217
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,080
begin for you. Okay. Um look at that. I

218
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,519
mean, as a child, you were wishing for

219
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,760
something, and now you're going to see

220
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,680
it come true.

221
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:18,519
Very cool. Spirit wants you to know that

222
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,519
you have safe paths. Oh my god.

223
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,800
It's because you shed something here.

224
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,120
There's a wish coming true. Okay, we

225
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,240
have wish again. Wish, wish, wish,

226
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,440
prayer. You have safe passage here.

227
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,646
Okay. And then we have the word yes.

228
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,040
So

229
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:47,360
[snorts] yes, you have safe passage.

230
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,080
Thanks, Ruby.

231
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,320
Yes, you have safe passage.

232
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,399
Yes, you have magical hands for someone.

233
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,640
That's interesting. Okay. Yes, you have

234
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,480
magical hands. There's something in your

235
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,800
hands. Have you been wondering that?

236
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,640
Yes, you're right. There's some kind of

237
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,760
energy coming out of your hands. That's

238
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,760
for someone specific.

239
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,760
But if you've been wondering, is it okay

240
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,880
to move on? It's is it okay to move

241
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,040
forward? The answer is yes. And it's

242
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,720
time to move forward.

243
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,519
Yes, there's some kind of wish coming in

244
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,720
here. Yes.

245
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,560
Yes. There's an answer to your prayer.

246
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:30,720
I want to get one of these.

247
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,680
So it's after a time of having to

248
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,320
be alone for a while and figure this out

249
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,720
and realize I can't save anybody but I

250
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,800
can save myself and become that example

251
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,720
for everyone around me. And by doing

252
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,839
that you are saving everyone.

253
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,000
And again not one person can save

254
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,959
humanity but you if you become that

255
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,200
example you invite others to join the

256
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,000
fight with you and then together you

257
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,560
will save humanity. It you this is how

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,680
it happens. I mean and this is how it is

259
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:08,120
happening. This is beautiful. So you're

260
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,120
making your life a moving prayer here.

261
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:15,312
>> [screaming]

262
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,332
>> Okay, Riri.

263
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:17,332
[laughter]

264
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,320
Okay, can you get one of these spirit?

265
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,720
That's way too many. You know what came

266
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,839
out was patience. It's almost like

267
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,839
spirit's like, "Be patient." [laughter]

268
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,880
So, do you see what I'm saying real

269
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,040
quick before I look at this card? I was

270
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,040
wanting a card when I wanted it, right?

271
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,399
It's not on my time, it's on spirit's

272
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,000
time. And then the card that came out

273
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,519
real quick was way too many cards. I

274
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,079
wasn't going to take it. But on the top,

275
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,480
it said patience. Okay, that's a message

276
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,440
in itself. We can't receive things when

277
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,839
we want it. Spirit knows, God knows, the

278
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,760
universe knows when we're ready for it.

279
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,160
And you're ready for something because

280
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,839
you have released the outcome. You have

281
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,959
released how it's going to come to you,

282
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,560
when it's going to come to you, what

283
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,079
it's going to look like. You released

284
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,040
all of that. So, it's coming.

285
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,519
change. Ooh, the dragonfly spirit. You

286
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,760
could be seeing dragonflies.

287
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,480
Beautiful. And then we have air spirit

288
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,560
knowledge. This is your mind that we're

289
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,320
talking about. This is what you've had

290
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,680
to change is the way you think.

291
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,760
And that, you know, we've been getting

292
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,079
the bear spirit a lot lately. Okay. Bear

293
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,800
is coming out again. That has been um

294
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,880
around you lately.

295
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,079
Um, and that this bear spirit, I just

296
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,720
want to say really quick, has been

297
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,279
helping you regain your personal power.

298
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,079
So, the dragonfly spirit is here to say

299
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,320
there is some change coming. There is a

300
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,160
change that is here. Not coming. It's

301
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,399
here.

302
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,399
It's here.

303
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,720
There's something about your reflection.

304
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,800
Uh, sorry, the cat's cleaning himself

305
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,600
right here.

306
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,440
H, yeah, it's your thinking. Okay. Air

307
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,000
spirit knowledge. There's some kind of

308
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,160
like um

309
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,920
the way you think is different. This is

310
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,600
what's happening. Okay. It's the way you

311
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,760
think.

312
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,200
It's your mental body. You are thinking

313
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,519
totally different. Like I said, you're

314
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,079
letting go of the outcome here. Okay?

315
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,760
You're releasing it. You don't care. You

316
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,600
know, that's God's job. It's not your

317
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,680
job to figure out the how, the where,

318
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,680
the when, the why, all that. You just

319
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:44,200
know um to become it. You are it. You

320
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,200
are the blessing. You are the prayer.

321
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,920
There's some kind of fairies around you

322
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,760
right now. There's a fairy in the

323
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,639
corner. Look at that. It's like you can

324
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,959
barely see her, but she's there.

325
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,880
There's a fairy around you that you

326
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,800
don't know about. You don't see them.

327
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,639
You don't know about this fairy, but

328
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,440
they're around you. And they're helping

329
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,240
you with this change.

330
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,079
They're helping you with this change.

331
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
They're helping you shift your mindset

332
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,000
here. You guys, you do have a fairy

333
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,720
around you.

334
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,880
Very cool. I love that.

335
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,720
So, what I want to do now is we're just

Okay.

someone here. You have a relationship or

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:28,160
a tie, a connection to Egypt. We have

Rah Rada coming out with soul flame. We

354
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,399
have Isis coming out magic manifesting.

355
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,519
Bottom of the deck we have Krishna with

356
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,519
devotion and we have Jesus.

357
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,199
I mean I've heard people say the the

358
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,040
relation the Krishna and Jesus are very

359
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,279
similar.

360
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,800
It says trust your spiritual guidance.

361
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:00,951
Your commitment has been recognized.

362
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,951
Devotion you guys. Devotion. [screaming]

363
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,839
Back up, Rever. You're too close. Sorry,

364
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,600
guys. Um, devotion. Your devotion has

365
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,120
been recognized. Um, you guys have

366
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,720
devotion. You have good intentions.

367
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,759
Saving your devotion has been

368
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,720
recognized. Spirit sees and Jesus sees,

369
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,800
Krishna sees how you love humanity and

370
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,880
how you want to help people so much.

371
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,320
Your devotion, you've been devoted to

372
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,199
this. Um, this is why. Okay. But here we

373
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,839
go. It says, "Experience relationship

374
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,600
harmony and healing.

375
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,720
Sacred connections." It says, "I nourish

376
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,120
my relationships with respect."

377
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,199
You guys, I'm so sorry. And I am not

378
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,079
starting this video over again.

379
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,920
No way. Sorry, guys, but you should have

380
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:48,079
seen what just happened. So, Riri got

381
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,839
too close to Charlie, and I've been

382
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,959
telling him that to back up, and he

383
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,759
won't listen. Finally, Charlie reached

384
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,839
out and went like that to Riri and Riri

385
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,839
jumped back and knocked over the camera.

386
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,600
That's what happened. Um, sorry guys,

387
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,439
but I'm leaving this in. I'm not going

388
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,760
to start this video over. Uh,

389
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:12,240
there's a reason why it happened. Um,

390
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,720
I feel like, um,

391
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,720
give me a second.

392
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,199
Someone could be um interfering with

393
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,839
something

394
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,799
that you're trying to do and it's almost

395
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,919
like you've been telling them to back

396
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,919
up. Leave me alone.

397
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,160
And I feel like someone just um

398
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,559
it's like you had to assert

399
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,559
assert your power

400
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,000
or show your strength in some way and

401
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,520
tell someone to back the up.

402
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,840
That's for someone specific that

403
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,440
happened for a reason. It'll resonate

404
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,880
with someone. It's almost like you've

405
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
been telling someone like, "Back up.

406
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,320
Back up. I don't want to hurt you. I

407
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,160
don't want to go there." But then

408
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,320
someone pushed you so hard to where

409
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,320
you're like, "Okay,

410
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,000
I guess I have to I guess I have to

411
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
stand up for myself." And spirit's been

412
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,320
waiting for that as well, for you to

413
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,320
stand up for yourself.

414
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,919
That was so crazy. Where was I? I don't

415
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,080
even um

416
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,679
your devotion has been recognized. Okay.

417
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,240
You have good intentions of saving

418
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,960
everyone. You had to save yourself first

419
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,799
and you had to realize to just become

420
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,640
the example that how do they say be

421
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,280
become the change you want to see in the

422
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,919
world. This is what you're doing. Okay.

423
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,919
Um so you have Isis and Rada coming out

424
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,919
here.

425
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is what I was

426
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,919
saying. It says redis rediscover a lost

427
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,480
part of yourself. And then is then it

428
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,480
says experience relationship harmony and

429
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,840
healing. And this is what's happening.

430
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,080
Okay. You are healing your

431
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,440
relationships. And this is happening

432
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,520
because you've healed yourself.

433
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,000
All right. So there is some kind of

434
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,160
magic manifesting with Isis. It says

435
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,480
your dreams, visions, and goals are

436
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,400
becoming a reality. Stay focused.

437
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,559
Your devotion is being recognized and

438
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,640
it's being rewarded here you guys with

439
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,120
this some kind of magic coming in.

440
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,720
You're manifesting something with we

441
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:28,640
have wish over here. Um we have prayer

442
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,120
over here and then we have wish over

443
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,600
here. Okay. And then over here it looks

444
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,840
like she's wishing on a star. There's

445
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,840
some kind of wish coming in that you are

446
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,840
manifesting.

447
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,799
And we have devotion a couple a couple

448
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,559
times too. Okay. It's your devotion to

449
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,480
this.

450
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,720
Okay. So we know we have Isis Rada

451
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,240
um and Krishna. And then Jesus popped

452
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,973
out from the back of that the back of

453
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,360
Krishna. Jesus was right behind Krishna.

454
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:03,440
[laughter]

455
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,280
Why do I feel this is like significant?

456
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,200
But I can't tap into the message. I

457
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,000
don't know what that is. But I feel like

458
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:16,120
this there's a message from Jesus and

459
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,120
Krishna and I don't know what that is.

460
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,840
Like Jesus says though on that card it

461
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,360
says it talks about forgiveness and it's

462
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,679
like you've had to either forgive

463
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,679
yourself or forgive someone else.

464
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,400
And this is how you're saving them.

465
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,640
It's by letting it go. Someone here

466
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,039
really wanted to save their family from

467
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,360
something. I feel like and you've

468
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,840
learned that just by letting it go

469
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,679
and becoming

470
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,080
becoming that energy that you would like

471
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,880
to see in them.

472
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,760
This is what's doing it.

473
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,840
All right. [laughter]

474
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,679
So, let's get a message here. Someone

475
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,200
just pulled up in my driveway. I have no

476
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,439
idea who this is. All

477
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,159
right.

478
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:09,760
[cough]

479
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,334
I swear if I could just stay in my

480
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,354
Hermit cave forever, I would. Trust me.

481
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:15,354
[laughter]

482
00:21:18,574 --> 00:21:20,594
[laughter]

483
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,280
Okay. What do we got? Oh, shut the You

484
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,280
have the star coming out, you guys.

485
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,440
There's a wish coming true. There's no

486
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,919
doubt in my freaking mind with Ace of

487
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,320
Wands at the bottom. Sorry, you can

488
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,320
hardly see that, huh? Um, Ace of Wands

489
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,919
at the bottom with the Star. You take

490
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:47,159
You're taking action on some kind of

491
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,159
wish here. You're wishing upon a star.

492
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,440
This is so crazy. There's a wish coming

493
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,440
true here.

494
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,360
And you guys, I just have to show you.

495
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,200
There's like the star. There's the earth

496
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,400
right here in the middle with with like

497
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,559
the star all around it. It's like you

498
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,559
wanted to save humanity or you wanted to

499
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,080
save people and you're going to be able

500
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,960
to do this and it's because you're

501
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,720
becoming that that example yourself.

502
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:26,039
This is like a wish come true of you

503
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,039
wanting to heal people or something.

504
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,680
H.

505
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,680
[laughter]

506
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,540
So interesting.

507
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,540
[laughter]

508
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,600
So so interesting. Okay, [laughter]

509
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
focus.

510
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:53,605
>> [laughter]

511
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,480
>> Okay. So, you're taking action on some

512
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,400
kind of

513
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,400
you've taken action on some kind of wish

514
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,400
fulfillment

515
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,799
by either praying about something.

516
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,280
You've been praying about something or

517
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,600
just having that intention.

518
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,559
And whatever this is, it's coming true.

519
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,720
It's going to be different for

520
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,400
everybody, whatever this wish is. Um,

521
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,880
but it's coming true. It's something

522
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,720
that you've been wanting.

523
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,919
and you've been devoted to changing your

524
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,240
life, changing who you are, changing

525
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,840
everything about yourself. And I don't

526
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,120
mean the stuff that you know, I'm

527
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,480
saying. You know what I'm saying?

528
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,520
Alchemizing, not changing. Alchemizing.

529
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,799
Hi, baby. Hey, what are you guys doing?

530
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,159
Sorry, guys. The cars just went

531
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,919
everywhere. Um, Charlie, what is wrong

532
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,679
with you? You just got up and freaked

533
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,280
out.

534
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:53,840
What's wrong? [laughter]

535
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:56,400
That's Shiva. Shiva's nice.

536
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,640
Okay, spirit. Any more cards here? I

537
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,320
mean, this is interesting. The Star and

538
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,720
Ace of Wands. It's like nothing else

539
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,320
wants to come out, [laughter]

540
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,679
you guys. Come on.

541
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,679
Why am I not getting another card?

542
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:12,861
[laughter]

543
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,440
Hm.

544
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,440
This is very interesting.

545
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,679
I don't think we need another card.

546
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:29,600
[laughter]

547
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,080
This has never happened before and I

548
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,559
have to go with it. I don't think we

549
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,760
need another card. The star is the only

550
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,760
card that's coming out right now.

551
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:42,992
>> [laughter]

552
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,679
>> I'm not going to press it, but one came

553
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,679
out. 10 of swords.

554
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:56,480
Like I said, it was your mental body.

555
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,360
It's your mental body that you have just

556
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,320
released some kind of something, some

557
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,880
kind of um mental conflict that you were

558
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,360
having about saving humanity or saving

559
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,960
someone in your family. And you've

560
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,960
released it with the T of swords. You

561
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,200
put it to bed.

562
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,520
Queen of Wands at the bottom. You

563
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,520
are becoming in touch. You're

564
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,760
manifesting.

565
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,400
This is I feel like um this goes with

566
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,919
the Isis card. Really? It's like you're

567
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,000
manifesting something. Someone here you

568
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,440
could be working with Isis um to

569
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,799
manifest something.

570
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,760
What's up with that?

571
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,440
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You have

572
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,159
been stabbed in the back a lot. You have

573
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,320
been um so much so much you've been your

574
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,080
mental body has been attacked. Um and it

575
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,840
really affected your confidence here,

576
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,600
okay, with the Queen of Wands. But

577
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,039
because you have put this to bed, I'm

578
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,799
feeling someone you're going through a

579
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,080
glow up, you guys. There's something

580
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,080
here about um your confidence coming

581
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,880
back, your inspiration coming back, your

582
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:05,960
creativity coming back, um some kind of

583
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,960
manifestation, power coming back to you,

584
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,159
your confidence. It's like you're ready.

585
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,640
You're I could be talking. What is going

586
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:19,878
on today? I mean, for real,

587
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,480
I'm having a little um trouble.

588
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,520
[laughter]

589
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,520
Let's try that again.

590
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:30,880
Here we go. Yeah.

591
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,440
Wow. You had to decide. Two of swords.

592
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,039
Okay. To go through this death and

593
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,400
rebirth.

594
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,799
It was vital is what I'm hearing. You

595
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,039
had to let this go. This two of swords

596
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,559
with the 10 of swords. You had to let

597
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,279
this go because this was seriously

598
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,600
breaking your heart.

599
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,200
This was making you

600
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,640
stuck. It's like it was too much. You

601
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,600
were putting too much weight on your

602
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,960
shoulders is what I'm hearing you guys.

603
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,159
Wanting to save everyone

604
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,000
and you don't have to do that. Okay. So,

605
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,003
you've learned to make a decision to go

606
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,799
through this death and rebirth here.

607
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:14,000
[laughter] And now with the star,

608
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:16,640
there's some kind of wish coming true.

609
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,200
Okay.

610
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,679
Anything else, spirit?

611
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,720
Yeah.

612
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,880
>> Yeah. Wow, you guys.

613
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,320
>> Jesus. Okay, so you have let something

614
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,240
go with the three of wands at the

615
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,320
bottom. Okay. The seven of what you let

616
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,640
go of was the seven of swords. Something

617
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,679
that was just mentally entrapping you

618
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,279
like it was making you feel these were

619
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,120
this was false information making you

620
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,720
feel like you had to save the world. You

621
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,400
were, like I said, you put too much

622
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,480
weight on your shoulders, too much

623
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,400
pressure. Two of wands. There you are

624
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,320
choosing a different energy to be in.

625
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,600
Not the seven of swords anymore. You're

626
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,799
I'm not going to use these because you

627
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,360
can't see them. Huh. Um you're choosing

628
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,399
a different path here. Um uh than the

629
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,399
seven of swords.

630
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,399
Three of wands right on the bottom. So

631
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,279
you've let this go and you're waiting

632
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,799
for the new to come in.

633
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,574
And what's coming in is some kind of

634
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,240
wish fulfillment. Um we'll get one more.

635
00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:15,869
[laughter]

636
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,869
It's okay, Charlie. [cough]

637
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,440
That's so interesting though. The star

638
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,039
right off the bat.

639
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:34,080
Boom. Here we go. Page of cups. Okay. At

640
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:35,760
the bottom, dreaming, wishing.

641
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,440
There's something you've been dreaming

642
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,799
about.

643
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,320
It's coming true. 10 of cups.

644
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,919
Whatever is coming in here, whatever

645
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,000
wish is coming in here, it's going to

646
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,000
make you feel extremely fulfilled.

647
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,200
And I will leave it there.

648
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,840
You're manifesting some kind of magic

649
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,760
here. Okay?

650
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,760
You've learned to let something go. And

651
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,480
this was

652
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,200
feeling like you had to save people.

653
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,440
Okay? And you have become some kind of

654
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,000
beautiful example here. And you are

655
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,159
making your life a moving prayer. Now

656
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,120
this is the message. And because of

657
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,960
that, you are saving people by being

658
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,279
that example for people. You're this is

659
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,799
how you're saving everyone. And it's not

660
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,480
that you're saving everyone. You're

661
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,640
learning how to save yourself and become

662
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,960
that example. But by doing that, it's

663
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,720
like you're inviting others to join this

664
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,880
fight with you. And together you will

665
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,399
save humanity. That's what I'm getting.

666
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,120
Okay. What I want to do really quick

667
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,720
before you go, you guys. Um Oh my god.

668
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,720
Twitter.

669
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,640
Oh god.

670
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,840
How did that happen, you guys? I turned

671
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,200
my back for what, 20 minutes?

672
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,679
>> Yeah, you did that, didn't you? That's

673
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,320
all right. It's okay. I will clean it

674
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:01,039
up.

675
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:04,240
Oh, you guys. Twitter

676
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,510
Twitter's having a dust bath, but she's

677
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,279
doing it

678
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,279
[laughter]

679
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,559
right next to everything that I have

680
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,279
here. And it's just it's got

681
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,520
It got dirt in there.

682
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,559
It's okay, Ri.

683
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:24,440
We're just going to get one.

684
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,440
I always say that, huh?

685
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,320
This is what it is. You put some worry

686
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,399
to bed. You put it this back into

687
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,960
balance. Okay. The twin flame is

688
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,720
balanced to me. Okay. And there's some

689
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,799
kind of worry that you've been worried I

690
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,799
I swear about the collective, about

691
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,799
saving people. This could be specific

692
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,279
family members or friends of yours that

693
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,039
you have been worried about saving and

694
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,520
you finally put it to bed and you put

695
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,520
things back into balance.

696
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,279
That's what it is. You were almost

697
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:57,520
obsessed with saving people. Okay? And

698
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,360
you're not anymore. You're learning that

699
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,679
I just can save myself and then become

700
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,279
that example for others. And in turn,

701
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,120
this is what you're doing is you are

702
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,360
saving people by doing this because like

703
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,320
I said, you're in you're inviting others

704
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,600
to join this fight with you. Um, and

705
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,679
together, boom. Okay. We can't do

706
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,679
anything by ourselves.

707
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,919
And people have to make a choice to live

708
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,080
for themselves as well. So, I think

709
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,080
you're learning that. My hair is crazy.

710
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,399
I don't care right now. Um, thank you

711
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,200
guys for accepting me exactly how I am

712
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,440
and not judging me. I really appreciate

713
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,799
that the most, you guys, because I have

714
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,279
a low self-esteem and it helps me to

715
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,440
know that I have people like you guys

716
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,919
that don't give a about that stuff.

717
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,600
They just want to hear the message and I

718
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,559
appreciate that a lot because it makes

719
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,919
me feel so much better. It really does

720
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,960
cuz then I don't have to come on here

721
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,559
and worry about physical stuff so much.

722
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,440
You know what I mean? which I'm learning

723
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,640
to yes to take care of myself but not to

724
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,120
overdo it, not to be so worried about

725
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,360
how I look and um stuff like this, you

726
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,679
know.

727
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,840
All right, that's just a side note.

728
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,360
Okay, so for um yeah, for some of you

729
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,640
guys, this is family members that you've

730
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,480
been trying to save and you're learning

731
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,240
that I can just be the example for them,

732
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,919
but by doing that, you are saving your

733
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,080
family by doing that. For others of you,

734
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,760
this is humanity on a bigger scale

735
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,519
wanting to save the world and putting

736
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,039
way too much pressure on yourself. And

737
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,960
you're learning that, hey, I can just be

738
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,039
the example and send an invitation to

739
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,799
others. That's all I can do. And by

740
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,559
doing this, you are saving people. Okay,

741
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,919
this is the message. Um, I'll see you in

742
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,440
the next one. Please let me know how

743
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,440
this resonated if you feel like. You

744
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:42,640
don't have to. Um, I'll see you in the

745
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,640
next one. No worries. Okay, love you.
