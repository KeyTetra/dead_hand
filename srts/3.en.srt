00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello chosen ones. Welcome to the

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,279
channel. Today I have a message for some

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,480
of us that is pretty specific. So just

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,840
ask God about it. But the message is you

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,240
are the coldest chosen one. So it's

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,080
definitely specific because not all the

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,640
people who are in a relationship with

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,560
the Lord Jesus Christ who have like sold

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,160
their soul out to God to where they're

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,240
being used in the kingdom of God in big

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,039
ways. They're major players out here in

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,800
the spiritual warfare that's happening.

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,800
Not all of you guys are meant to be

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,480
cold. Not all of us are meant to have

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,840
this um specific part of our

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,480
personality. You know, it's it's it's

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,360
it's only for a specific group of the

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,079
chosen ones out here. And so, but the

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,440
message is that you are the coldest.

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,079
Okay? So, you have some kind of part of

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,480
your personality that is ice cold. it

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
is. Um, you might have been called cold

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,559
before. People might have told you like,

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,480
"Damn, you're cold." Or you might have

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,720
just had moments where you realized

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,119
like, "Damn, I'm cold." Or something

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,200
something is like kind of dead inside

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,320
with me or something's very cold, you

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,400
know. And um, you know, the ironic thing

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,799
is that for some of us, for most of us

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,600
who this is for, you were actually born

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,119
as like the most empathic. You were born

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,040
as like the most loving, most

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,240
compassionate, the most sensitive, the

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,000
most emotionally just um driven and and

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,759
open with your love and just very

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
compassionate and sensitive and

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,520
empathic. And you especially are very

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,159
compassionate toward animals and

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
children. And you were able to sense

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
very, you know, compassionate uh

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,960
empathic souls that were also out there

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,320
that you would feel all of this uh

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,640
strong sense of love for. But

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,960
something happened to where it was just

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,520
either ingrained in your personality for

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,520
you to just become colder and colder as

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,840
you grew up because of just the way that

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,680
your brain was built. And then for some

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,799
God had to let you go through

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,880
experiences that totally sh changed your

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,239
personality that completely transformed

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,040
you into somebody who is extremely cold.

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,319
And so there are a lot of reasons for

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,879
this, but one of them is that for some

56
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,319
you're supposed to go very very far in

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,959
this reality and to to deal with people

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,680
from a very high place. And you just

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,599
have to be extremely cold to be able to

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,920
make it in a high place like that. You

61
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,920
have to be able to deal with

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,120
sharks and like the worst of the worst

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,120
kind of people, the most brutal types of

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,000
coldest types of cold-blooded people

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,080
ever. So, you have to be able to um be

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,640
at the same level with these people. And

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,400
so God is saying that you have actually

68
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,080
come through a completion where you are

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,680
the coldest. You are colder than any

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,760
coldblooded

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,239
Mcavelian dark triad personality type

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,360
out here that uh you can be more

73
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,000
coldblooded than that person um than a

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,120
full than a full-blown like uh you know

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,200
Satanist or somebody who is um you know

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,280
even trying to be dead inside or trying

77
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,319
to be the coldest. You are naturally

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,319
colder than they are because of your

79
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,640
calling and because you have followed

80
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,080
God through whatever experiences that

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,159
you were meant to go through to become

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
this person and to have this gift. So

83
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,280
you have been given this gift of of

84
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,599
being able to be ice cold. It's almost

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,760
inhuman how cold you're able to be. You

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,680
can go through situations that other

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,360
that would terrify other people that

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,720
would make other people extremely

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,480
uncomfortable that they wouldn't be able

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,640
to handle it because you just have to be

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,519
so cold-blooded to get through that kind

92
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,920
of a situation. And because you are who

93
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,239
you are now that that God has changed

94
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,159
you, you are able to go into these

95
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,280
situations that other people wouldn't be

96
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,080
able to to get into. Okay. So, but God

97
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,319
is saying that, you know, um this is

98
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
part of what is going to bring you into

99
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,000
your destiny and it's a major part of

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,519
what you had to become in order to get

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,920
there. But that it doesn't make you any

102
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,920
less of a person who loves God. It

103
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,920
doesn't make you any less of God's child

104
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,680
because you are still that loving,

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,440
empathic, sensitive, compassionate

106
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,840
person on the inside and you still have

107
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,960
this heart that is so soft for certain

108
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,759
people. But um you you know are only

109
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,840
going to show that to innocent beings,

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,240
you know, to beings that are not evil

111
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
that deserve it and that this is a part

112
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,520
of God's calling for your life and that

113
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,919
you're meant to be this way. And some

114
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,360
people might try to demonize you for

115
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,280
being such a cold-blooded person

116
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,800
sometimes. And God is saying that when

117
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,560
that happens, you have to remember that

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,240
no, actually, this is God's gift to me

119
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,720
because he wanted me to be able to go

120
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,960
very far and to deal with the coldest of

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,040
the cold-blooded per people out here.

122
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,240
And this is my gift that God's given me

123
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,320
for survival. Okay. And I am just also

124
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,160
getting that, you know, some of some of

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,240
us might think that we're too cold to

126
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,040
ever be able to find a person who like

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,039
is a partner or to find that, you know,

128
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,600
spouse or whatever because we're just

129
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,000
too cold blooded. I got to say that he

130
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,039
has already set you up with somebody who

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,560
is just very similar as you to where you

132
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,639
guys are going to understand the

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,479
coldness of each other. It's uh going to

134
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,320
be something very very familiar

135
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,520
between the two of you, okay? Where

136
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,280
you're just going to have a very deep

137
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,199
understanding of why you are the way you

138
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,639
are and who you actually are on the

139
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,800
inside behind this mask of coldness.

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,720
So, but I'm going to go ahead and pull

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,320
some cards, but I'm just getting that,

142
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,160
you know, for some of us, you have come

143
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,520
through a major completion. I'm just

144
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,440
seeing the world that you have gone

145
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,919
through a major healing process. um

146
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,840
where years and years and years of you

147
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,479
experiencing the worst of the worst

148
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,880
kinds of situations with the worst of

149
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,600
the worst types of people has all come

150
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,840
together into this uh season of healing

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,840
where you have just um absorbed

152
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,880
everything and you've uh allowed God to

153
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,720
just filter everything through uh in in

154
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,759
in a way to where this coldness has been

155
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
purified and and and you just um you are

156
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,160
experienced on a whole another level.

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,120
Okay. So, I'm just getting that you are

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,800
now ready to be in any room with um any

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,560
type of person and you could be

160
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,880
surrounded by a whole bunch of sharks.

161
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,600
You could be surrounded by the most uh

162
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,039
terrifying like you know attorneys or

163
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,840
just I don't know the types of

164
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,600
personalities that are so intimidating.

165
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,840
Whereas before you might have just come

166
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,479
into a room like this and and you might

167
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,840
have felt like they get to call all the

168
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,120
shots like they get to make all the

169
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,639
decisions. they're higher than me,

170
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,919
they're better than me, you know,

171
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,479
they're just the these people are

172
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,319
cutthroat or whatever. But because you

173
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,319
are who you are now, you can go into

174
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,319
these types of rooms and know that no,

175
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,639
actually, I'm the coldest [ __ ] here.

176
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,479
Um, and it don't make me any less of a

177
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,039
chosen one that I am the most

178
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,599
cold-blooded [ __ ] here. And it don't

179
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,919
make me any less of a cold-blooded [ __ ]

180
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,319
because I have this facade or I have

181
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,400
this uh, you know, natural personality

182
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,000
of kindness and compassion and empathy.

183
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,199
And I might show that to you once in a

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,440
while, but that don't mean that um that

185
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,520
I ain't more cutthroat than you are or

186
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,599
that that uh that I'm scared of you in

187
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,680
any way because I am the coldest person

190
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,639
received through your faithfulness in

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,520
following the Lord Jesus Christ beyond

192
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,280
church and beyond religious fear. Okay?

darkness where God really called you to

196
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,360
religious people who tried to stop you

Even though you might also be the nicest

person there. Yeah. because you you uh

287
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,720

completely broke your heart into

291
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,760
billions of pieces, and you continued to

292
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,519
uh to follow God and to do what he said.

293
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,240

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,800
instantly. like you don't give a damn

299
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,200
about nobody's feelings. All right? If

300
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,040
if you catch the first sign of somebody

301
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,480
being an op, you don't give a damn about

302
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,480
their feelings anymore from that point

303
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,120

304
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,040

Oh my god. So this has just brought you

306
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,480
into the place of um

307
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,880
of major destiny of being able to

308
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,120
receive everything that is coming in

309
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,680

in a huge way and actually another thing

313
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,800
is that you know you're suddenly going

314
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,800

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,000
God has created for you. It's somebody

317
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,880
who is similar to you. They know your

318
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,800
coldness and they they understand

319
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,399
that that that isn't actually who you

320
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,320
are in your heart that that's who your

321
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,800
flesh is because you have to be this

322
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,399
person. But in your heart, they they're

323
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,760

because of this. All right? It's going

327
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
to be a very deep intimate relationship

328
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,920
that only you guys understand each

329
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,040

much filled with joy and happiness and

331
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,959
brightness. All right? And this is going

332
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,120
to be a wish, a major wish come true.

333
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,120
But that, you know, this is also having

334
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,720

340
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,240
first few minutes of getting to know you

342
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,920

361
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,279
success because of this.

362
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Okay.

363
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,160
So yeah, this is why God has allowed you

364
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
to go through all these pains. Okay. So

365
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,120
I'm going to leave it there. I'm also

366
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,279
seeing Virgo and Gemini.

367
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,959
But um I hope this message helps. Chosen

368
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,880
ones. I love you guys so much. All

369
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:27,360
right. And uh

370
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,880
And God just wants you to know that you

371
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,440
you you know, you will shine. Your real

372
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,240
heart and your real soul is so beautiful

373
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,560
and so lit and it's just so intuitive

374
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,240
and compassionate and empathic. And God

375
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,399
is not going to have you live in this

376
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,800
coldness forever. He's going to give you

377
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,720
that person or that situation or that

378
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,279
private life or that place, that safe

379
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,600
place where you're with the the the

380
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,680
people or the the animals and the

381
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,160
children or a place where you can really

382
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,760
share your real light and that God is

383
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,320
saying your real light, your real heart

384
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,320
is so beautiful.

385
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,480
All right? and he gave you this

386
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,040
incredibly cold ego to survive, to be

387
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,920
able to harbor this beautiful energy

388
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:16,639
while while also surviving. Okay, so I'm

389
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,120
going to leave it there and uh I'll see
