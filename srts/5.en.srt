1
00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:05,520
[sighs and gasps] Okay, all my batteries

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,440
have failed. Everything has failed. I

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,920
have a 26% remaining on that one.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,440
All right, so I'm going to show you guys

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,240
something. Show you guys something. If

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,400
you ever have to start a generator, a

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,600
small generator specifically, at least

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,279
the one with the low oil lights or with

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,439
an oil shut off. Uh, keep in mind I have

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,320
zero W30 in my generator and I am still

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,600
going to uh suffer the problem that

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,600
you're about to witness. Um, so before I

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,719
get into everything, uh, thank you

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,079
everybody for supporting my GoFundMe. I

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,920
really need it. Um,

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,640
things are not awesome. So, let me try

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,640
to give you some useful content in

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,640
return.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,800
And um

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,520
so the GoFundMe is to get a battery so I

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,080
don't have to keep doing this.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:09,680
I'm going to show you what'll happen is

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,520
your oil is going to be thick.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,479
I'm at such a temperature right now that

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,119
I can't run this machine without a

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,439
heater. You'll see here. So there's my

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,439
generator and there's a heater stuck to

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,150
it. That heater is going right into the

29
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,840
air intake. You see?

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,840
[sighs]

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,119
So,

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,439
I'm having to even heat the oil as it's

33
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,200
running just to keep it running. Okay.

34
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,079
So, here's what we're going to do. Uh

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,079
I'll set up the uh

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,360
set the camera right over here. You guys

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,520
can you guys can kind of see what I'm

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,399
doing here. So, I might be able to pull

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:56,200
it without the choke. Nope.

40
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,200
So, we can set the choke.

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,560
Pull it.

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,640
Going to take the choke off. Okay.

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,680
Now, see, it's running right now. Watch

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,319
what it'll do.

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,319
Watch, watch, watch.

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,800
There you go. It just shut off. That's

47
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,040
the low oil light.

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,239
The wrong answer is to put more oil in

49
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,920
it because it has the correct amount of

50
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,920
oil in it. What's happening is your oil

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,920
pump.

52
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,800
Your oil pump's not picking it up.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,440
It's too solid. It's It's not viscous

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,280
enough.

55
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,920
So, you your oil pump's going to keep

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,560
shutting you down. And uh you may be

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,440
very frustrated wondering

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,000
why

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,360
won't this thing start? It says there's

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,599
low oil. I have oil. I know. Shut down

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,120
again. Yep. And what you have to do

62
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,159
Wait till the Wait till the light shuts

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,159
off. There you go.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,720
And so what I'm doing is I'm just keep

65
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,720
on turning it on. Keep on turning it on.

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,959
Letting that

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,480
the engine

68
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,720
eventually get warm enough

69
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,720
to where

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,440
it can warm up that oil. The other

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,159
answer is to take this,

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,280
unplug everything, take it inside, let

73
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,280
the oil loosen up, set it by the wood

74
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,280
stove

75
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,000
about 30 minutes or so,

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,760
or you just keep on doing this. Um,

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,319
so I'm let I'm doing this to prove a

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,319
point to show you

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,920
it will keep shutting down.

80
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,959
Just keep restarting it

81
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,200
and it will eventually work. So you can

82
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,200
watch me just kind of do it again and

83
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,200
again.

84
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,880
The worst thing you could ever do in

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,040
this situation is add more oil. Uh

86
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,600
what'll happen is now your now your

87
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,280
machine will be it'll work. It'll

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,280
instantly start sucking that other oil

89
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,280
up

90
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,880
start sucking through the uh you know

91
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,639
pumping through the oil properly.

92
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,520
Jesus. But

93
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,520
then it's going to be over full.

94
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,800
Uh it's going to develop pressure. It's

95
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,800
going to be overpressurized. It's going

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,800
to push oil up uh into your cylinders

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,240
and that you don't want.

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
It's going to push up into your

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,759
cylinders and what doesn't burn is going

100
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,639
to go out your exhaust

101
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,360
and then you can

102
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,680
you risk all sorts of issues doing that.

103
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,680
I mean,

104
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,039
you risk all sorts of issues doing that,

105
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,039
so I don't recommend.

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,120
It's ridiculous, isn't it? So, this is

107
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,560
why I need that battery. Um, this is one

108
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,960
of the reasons here

109
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,400
just to not have to constantly do this

110
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,759
to beg my machine to work

111
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,759
when I need it to work. You know,

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
sucks.

113
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,360
Every time I want electricity, this is

114
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,360
how it has to happen.

115
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,600
Just ridiculous.

116
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,080
Oh, come on.

117
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,000
So, thanks to people who supported the

118
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,000
GoFundMe right now. Uh, I'm up tound and

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
um

120
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,759
I'm still at $134.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,600
Still at $134. Um,

122
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,120
Jesus damn Christ, dude. Start. I need

123
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,120
you to start.

124
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,759
This sucks. Try doing this at like 3:30

125
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,759
in the morning.

126
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,440
Woke up out of bed cold, naked,

127
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,240
trying to get dressed in your [ __ ]

128
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,080
cold ass dark house

129
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,080
to get out here and do this.

130
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,000
This sucks.

131
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,000
But like I said, you know,

132
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,599
worst thing you could do is just add

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,240
more oil right now. Just keep on

134
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,759
reefing.

135
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
The other answer, like I said, is to

136
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,360
take it inside. But you see how long

137
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,360
it's taking.

138
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,479
This sucks. My life sucks.

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,960
For now, it'll get better.

140
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,680
Dude,

141
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,680
stop [ __ ] slamming.

142
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:00,440
The wind is causing that door to open

143
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,440
and close and slam.

144
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,879
This thing will get there eventually.

145
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
All right.

146
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,280
Are we about there? You think? You think

147
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,280
it's going to keep going?

148
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Good.

149
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,000
I think it might. It still might shut

150
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,000
off. So

151
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,785
[sighs]

152
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,000
It's just what it is, dude. You got to

153
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,000
accept your lot in life.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,480
Wait for the damn

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,320
It be so nice and I get a battery for

156
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,720
real. Cuz I might get a battery and then

157
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,320
I'll just charge it up

158
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,320
and then I don't have to [ __ ] do

159
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,320
this.

160
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,480
I could,

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,800
you know,

162
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,240
the one battery gives me three days

163
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,240
worth of power. Three days

164
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:26,120
instead of having to do this.

165
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,120
And then there's the waste of fuel. Like

166
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:36,800
it cost me $75 a day.

167
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,800
Like $87 to $8 a day.

168
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,120
just for electricity

169
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,120
unsustainable.

170
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,720
I think it might actually stay going

171
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,720
this time.

172
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,880
Yeah, that's why I get that heater stuck

173
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,399
right on that intake to heat up that oil

174
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,240
on the oil pump. So,

175
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,160
yeah, I have that little heater, little

176
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,360
500 watt

177
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,120
stuck right on the uh

178
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,880
stuck right on the air intake there to

179
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,079
warm up the heat pump or oil pump, you

180
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,079
know? You know what I'm saying?

181
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,079
Oh,

182
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:32,480
[snorts] freaking cold.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,279
It's still pretty warm in here. You know

184
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,160
what is it in here? 78°. Yeah, cuz I

185
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,399
just get this when I'm at home. Be nice

186
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,399
if I could start working from home again

187
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,160
cuz I I'm missing out on money. This is

188
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,680
ridiculous. But um

189
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,720
yeah, when I'm here, I can get that

190
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,560
thing I can get the wood stove roaring.

191
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,007
78 degrees. That's what I want. I want

192
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,720
it more like 84.

193
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:58,800
[sighs] But yeah, that's what I have to

194
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,000
do. Just fight it like that. And that

195
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,480
that's merely to um to charge the

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,360
laptop.

197
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,560
Yeah.

198
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,440
And to have a light.

199
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,440
Real great use of resources, right?

200
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Yeah.

201
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,320
Yeah. So, look in the description.

202
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:28,200
GoFundMe. I know I'm harping on it, but

203
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm I'm [ __ ] desperate.

204
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,079
You see kind of why a little bit, you

205
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,079
know?
